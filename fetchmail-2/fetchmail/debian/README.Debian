  This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of fetchmail -- an
email-retrieval and forwarding utility.

 Two files have been included (fetchmail-up and fetchmail-down, found in
/usr/doc/fetchmail) that can be used in /etc/ppp/ip-up.d and ip-down.d.
Until there's a clear policy about the ip-up.d and ip-down.d directories,
this will have to be done manually.
