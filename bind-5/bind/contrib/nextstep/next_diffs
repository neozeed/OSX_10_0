+ 
+ This is my first pass at porting BIND 8.x (T5B) to NeXTSTEP 3.3.
+ The port was done under NeXTSTEP 3.3, m68k with GCC 2.7.2,
+ snapshot 970314 and custom patches and installation. (I have
+ successfully compiled the code using NeXT's CC; however, I 
+ didn't try to run it.) The Makefile.set file in ports/next is
+ set to my GCC compiler version. I could have set it to NeXT's CC
+ but my environment is different and simply compiling with
+ NeXT's CC in my environment isn't a good indicator it will
+ compile cleanly in yours. :) 
+ 
+ Note: The compilation uses the POSIX option--so be sure to have
+ those patches. :) 
+ 
+ Note: The compilation process does not like the GCC header file
+ unistd.h. I did not look to see how to cleanly work around the
+ problem, so I deleted it. 
+ 
+ Note: There is a problem with the "irs" stuff. Specifically, it
+ does not compile cleanly and is missing NetInfo capabilities.
+ I'm not sure what to do about the irs issue and a request for help
+ to bind-workers went unanswered. For myself, I simply deleted
+ it from "SUBDIRS" in lib/Makefile and got on with it. You'll
+ have to do the same.
