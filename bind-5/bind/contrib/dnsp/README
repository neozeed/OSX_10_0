hey paul,

thought you might like to take a peek at this tool,
and possibly throw it into the bind contrib.

useful, and im sure it'll help the other geeks out
there who have been coding it themselves.

great for diagnosing your network, and others.

any opinions, additions or whatnot would be
gratefully appreciated.
