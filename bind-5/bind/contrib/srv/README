The files in this directory are a simple hack to do SRV lookups, and a
test program for it.

The getsrv() function goes from a (domain, service, protocol) triplet
such as (gulbrandsen.priv.no, test, tcp) to a list of servers for that
service for that domain.  It does not have particularly good error
checking, and it's blocking.

The freesrvhost() frees the srvhost struct returned by the first
function.

There are test/tcp SRV RRs in the gulbrandsen.priv.no domain, so that
"./srvtest test gulbrandsen.priv.no" should always give output
somewhat like this:

	$ ./srvtest test gulbrandsen.priv.no
	   10     3 lupinella.troll.no:3
	   10     1 lupinella.troll.no:1
	   20     4 lupinella.troll.no:400
	   20     2 lupinella.troll.no:200
	   20     2 lupinella.troll.no:201

Five SRVs is a bit over the top and those port numbers aren't what I'd
really use, but hey, it's meant as a test.

Since the public domain does not exist as a concept in Norwegian law,
we cannot release this hack into the public domain.  So:

	Copyright 1998 Troll Tech.  Use, modification and distribution
	is allowed without limitation, warranty, or liability of any
	kind.

Good luck.  You may well need to change it - my first change was to
c++-ize it and make it nonblocking.  (These changes had the side
effect of making it too complex for use as an example and dependent on
too much to be distributed in this contrib directory.)
