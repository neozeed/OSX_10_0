.SH NAME
nslint - perform consistency checks on dns files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nslint
[
.B -d
] [
.B -b
.I named.boot
] [
.B -B
.I nslint.boot
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Nslint
reads the nameserver configuration files and performs a number of
consistency checks on the dns records. If any problems are discovered,
error messages are displayed on
.I stderr
and
.B nslint
exits with a non-zero status.
.LP
Here is a short list of errors
.B nslint
detects:
.IP
Records that are malformed.
.IP
Names that contain dots but are missing a trailing dot.
.IP
.B PTR
records with names that are missing a trailing dot.
.IP
Names that contain illegal characters (rfc1034).
.IP
.B A
records
without matching
.B PTR
records
.IP
.B PTR
records
without matching
.B A
records
.IP
Addresses in use by more than one name.
.IP
Names with
.B CNAME
and other records (rfc1033).
.IP
Unknown service and/or protocol keywords in
.B WKS
records.
.IP
Missing quotes.
.LP
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -b
Specify an alternate
.I named.boot
file. The default is
.I /etc/named.boot
(just like
.IR named (8)).
.TP
.B -B
Specify an alternate
.I nslint.boot
file. The default is
.I nslint.boot
in the last
.B directory
line processed in
.I named.boot
(or the current working directory).
This file is processed like a second
.IR named.boot .
The most common use is to tell
.B nslint
about
.B A
records that match
.B PTR
records that point outside the domains listed in
.IR named.boot .
.TP
.B -d
Raise the debugging level. Debugging information is
displayed on
.IR stdout .
.LP
.SH "ADVANCED CONFIGURATION"
There are some cases where it is necessary to use the
advanced configuration features of
.BR nslint .
Advanced configuration is done with the
.I nslint.boot
file.
.LP
The most common is when a site has a demilitarized zone (DMZ).
The problem here is that the DMZ network will have
.B PTR
records for hosts outside its domain. For example lets say
we have
.I 128.0.rev
with:
.LP
.RS
.nf
.sp .5
1.1     604800  in      ptr     gateway.lbl.gov.
2.1     604800  in      ptr     gateway.es.net.
.sp .5
.fi
.RE
.LP
Obviously we will define an
.B A
record for
.I gateway.lbl.gov
pointing to
.I 128.0.1.1
but we will get errors because there is no
.B A
record defined for
.IR gateway.es.net .
The solution is to create a 
.I nslint.boot
file (in the same directory as the other dns files)
with:
.LP
.RS
.nf
.sp .5
primary es.net                  nslint.es.net
.sp .5
.fi
.RE
.LP
And then create the file
.I nslint.es.net
with:
.LP
.RS
.nf
.sp .5
gateway 1       in      a       128.0.1.2
.sp .5
.fi
.RE
.LP
Another problem occurs when a pseudo host is setup to allow two more
more actual hosts provide a service. For, let's say that
.I lbl.gov
contains:
.LP
.RS
.nf
.sp .5
server  604800  in      a       128.0.6.6
server  604800  in      a       128.0.6.94
;
tom     604800  in      a       128.0.6.6
tom     604800  in      mx 0    lbl.gov.
;
jerry   604800  in      a       128.0.6.94
jerry   604800  in      mx 0    lbl.gov.
.sp .5
.fi
.RE
.LP
In this case
.B nslint
would complain about missing
.B PTR
records and ip addresses in use by more than one host.
To suppress these warnings, add you would the lines:
.LP
.RS
.nf
.sp .5
primary lbl.gov                 nslint.lbl.gov
primary 0.128.in-addr.arpa      nslint.128.0.rev
.sp .5
.fi
.RE
.LP
to
.I nslint.boot
and create
.I nslint.lbl.gov
with:
.LP
.RS
.nf
.sp .5
server  1       in      allowdupa       128.0.6.6
server  1       in      allowdupa       128.0.6.94
.sp .5
.fi
.RE
.LP
and create
.I nslint.128.0.rev
with:
.LP
.RS
.nf
.sp .5
6.6     604800  in      ptr     server.lbl.gov.
94.6    604800  in      ptr     server.lbl.gov.
.sp .5
.fi
.RE
.LP
In this example, the
.B allowdupa
keyword tells
.B nslint
that it's ok for
.I 128.0.6.6
and
.I 128.0.6.94
to be shared by
.IR server.lbl.gov ,
.IR tom.lbl.gov ,
and
.IR jerry.lbl.gov .
