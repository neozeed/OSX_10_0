That's about what all of you sent me.  I'm sorry to disappoint you but
all the library does is to build and parse DNS packets.  The asynchrounous
stuff was done in the X program which used the library.  Nevertheless it
might help someone build a library routine which is able to do the same.

I made the tar file available for retrieving on ftp.huji.ac.il:
/pub/network/ntp/xdns.tar.gz,  that's the entire X program (which does
NOT compile for me now because it uses some extra libs, but worked fine
back then).

Here is the README file I compiled, so you don't have to retrieve it if you
don't like it.

Enjoy,

This directory contains sources for an incomplete X interface for
Domain Name Service 'digging' tool.  The program used to work on Suns
running SunOS 4.* sometime during '92.  I can't compile it today
because it requires the Widget Creation Library (Wcl) and maybe some
other stuff which we don't have now.

The code in dnslib.c and dnslib.h helps to deal with the various
fields of the DNS packets in C programs more easely.

The asynchrounous code some people asked about (3 people in 5
minutes since I mentioned it :) is actually a re-arrengment of
the basic query sending routine from the DNS packege writen by Paul Vixie.
This is done in the file sendquery.c

Please be fair and give credit when credit is due (allready had my
FTP library code drowned in the sources of Xarchie :)

Enjoy, and please let me know what you are doing with this.
