Updatehosts nameserver configuration system. Release 1.1.0

The updatehosts package enables the management of DNS tables by using a
friendlier format than the standard zone file format. One important
benefit of this system is all host related information can be stored in one
place and system administrators which employ multiple nameservers such as
DNS and NIS can maintain all host related information in a single set of
relational files.

See the file INSTALL for installation instructions.

See the file OVERVIEW for an overview of the system design and
architecture.
