UPGRADING FROM A PREVIOUS RELEASE

Version 1.1.0 added the "options relation to the set of database files.  You
will need to add this name to the filelist in the updatehosts.env file.
Also the "netbios_ns" field has been added to the "subnet" relation.
Also several constants have been added to the poke_ns.env file for
configuring the log tailing functionality when restarting the nameserver.
See the section on poke_ns.

INSTALLING THE UPDATEHOSTS SYSTEM

After unpacking the system run the configure script in the directory.
This will try and determine some system defaults and the location of
various programs.

You can set the "staff" group used by the poke_ns utility to an alternate
group by running:

./configure --enable-staff_group=group_name

where group_name is the name of the group.  The default is "staff".

At this point you will need to create two configuration files -
updatehosts.env and poke_ns.env.  Templates of these files are found in
the source directory.  Modify them as needed for your particular system
configuration.

poke_ns.env sets a few system specific parameters for the poke_ns
utility.  poke_ns needs the pathname to the named binary
plus the location of the named.pid file and the location of the debug
output and the dump file for named.  poke_ns is installed setuid to
root, but only executable by its group.  The default group is "staff".
This can be changed to suit your local requirements.  The group execute
privilege lets the nameserver system be administered by any user in the
specific group without needing root privilege.

A log tailing function when the nameserver is restarted or reloaded can be
enabled by setting the following constants:

LOGFILE=/var/adm/messages
TAIL_LOGGER=/usr/local/bin/tail_log
TAIL_END=Ready to answer queries
TAIL_TIMEOUT=10

If TAIL_LOGGER is set then the specified tail logging program is enabled.
The defaults are shown which are suficient for most installations.

If you do not wish to enable group access, you can, of course,
disable it and manage the DNS files under the root user or under an
alternate userid.

updatehosts.env sets system parameters which drive the zone file and
bootstrap file creation process.  See the example in this directory
for typical setting.

You should also create a symlink from /etc/named.boot for V4 BIND or
/etc/named.conf for V8 bind to the boot file by the same name in the zone
file directory (shown as /var/named in the example).

The zone file directory should be group writable.  This allows users
in the group to manage the nameserver files.  You may also have the
input relations kept under SCCS or RCS control by setting the
appropriate parameter in the updatehosts.env file to "yes".  The
initial zone files should be created under the appropriate source
control system first.  Also the SCCS or RCS commands must be in the DNS
administrators path.

Then type

make

to make the binaries followed by

make install

to install the executable files, config files, and man pages.

Both poke_ns.env and updatehosts.env are installed in the system
installation directory set during the configuration process.  The
default is /usr/local/etc.  They should be only writable by root.
poke_ns checks to insure the poke_ns.env file is only writable by root
to prevent unauthorized users from gaining root access by altering the
environment file.

The script installdb will install empty template files for the system
in the database directory (default is /var/named/db).  If you have
existing zone files you can use the cvtzone script to convert the zone
files to relational format.  This script should do most of the
necessary work, but it has not been extensively tested, so the output
may need to be edited.  If you have a static host table in /etc/hosts
format, the cvtstatic script may be useful in converting existing host
data.

Once you have the relational files installed, you can test the system
by running:

updatehosts -v

The -v option will give you extra debugging output.  Besides it is fun
to watch the system do its work.  At this point you can then start the
nameserver.  Once you install the initial zone files, the updatehosts
script will automatically restart the nameserver.

See the file OVERVIEW for a tutorial on the use of the system.
