.TH DNSPROXY 8
.SH NAME
dnsproxy \- DNS proxy server for multi-lingual DNS

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dnsproxy
[ \-daemon ] [ \-config <config\-file> ] [ \-logfile <log\-file> ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dnsproxy
resides between application (resolver) and DNS server.
.PP
It accepts DNS requests from application (resolver) and converting
domain names in those requests into DNS server's acceptable encoding,
and forward those converted requests. It also accepts responses from
DNS server and converting domain names in those resopnses into
application's acceptable encoding and forward those responses to
applications.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-daemon
Run dnsproxy as daemon.  Otherwise, dnsproxy will run as normal
console program.
.TP
.B \-config <config\-file>
Specifies configuration file (see later).  If not specified,
dnsproxy uses default configuration file.
See
.B FILES
section for default configuration file.
.TP
.B \-logfile <log\-file>
Specifies logging file. If not specified.
dnsproxy uses default logging file.
See
.B FILES
section for default configuration file.

.SH CONFIGURATION
Configuration file is simple text file which defines several
configuration data.
.IP "listen <address>"
.RS
Defines listening port (both TCP and UDP).  <address> is one of
.RS
.PP
<IP address>:<port number>
.br
:<port number>
.br
<IP address>
.PP
.RE
If omitted, dnsproxy uses default value shown below.
.RS
.PP
IP Address      INADDR_ANY (0.0.0.0)
.br
port number     53
.PP
.RE
.RE
.IP "forward <address> [ bind4compat ]"
.RS
Defines forwarding server's address.  Format is same as 'listen'.
.PP
example:
.RS
forward 10.1.2.3
.RE
.PP
If "bind4compat" was given, dnsproxy uses above listen port
as forwading UDP's source address.  If not given, dnsproxy uses
port > 1024 as forwading UDP's source.
.RE
.IP "log-file <path>"
.RS
Defines log file name.  It may be overridden with command line
option '-logfile <path>'.  If no log file given, dnsproxy writes
log data into "/tmp/dnsproxy.log".
Sending SIGHUP causes dnsproxy to close the log file and then reopen it.
.RE
.IP "client-translation <ZLD> <Encoding>"
.RS
Defines client side character encoding scheme.  Some clients
locally encode domain name and add <ZLD> (Zero Level Domain) to
it.  In those cases, use <ZLD> and specify corresponding encoding.
Usually, no mDNS'nized client passes domain name in client's
local encoding.  For those case, use '.' as ZLD.  You may
specify several 'client-translation's if client uses several
encoding with different ZLD.
.PP
example:
.RS	
.nf
client-translation .i-dns.net UTF-5     # accept ZLDs
client-translation .          Shift_JIS
.fi
.RE    
.PP
Acceptable ZLD will depend on client programs.  Also acceptable
encodings depend on client and the implementation of `iconv()' function,
which dnsproxy uses internally for encoding conversion.
Check the document on `iconv()' for acceptable encoding names.
.RE
.IP "alternate-encoding <Encoding>"
.RS
Defines client side alternative encoding scheme.  The alternative
encoding will be used when the conversion from server-side encoding
to the default local encoding is failed due to the lack of mapping
some certain characters to the local character set.
.PP
example:
.RS	
alternate-encoding\ \ RACE
.RE    
.PP
The alternative encoding must be an ASCII compatible encoding, such as RACE.
.RE
.IP "normalize <Normalization Scheme> ..."
.RS
Defines domain name normalization schemes.  You can specify
several normalizations and they are applied left to right.
.PP
example:
.RS
normalize ja-fullwidth unicode-form-c
.RE
.PP
Acceptable normalizations depend on 'libmdn' library.  Check
documents for 'libmdn' for more detail.
.RE
.IP "server-translation <Encoding>"
.RS
Defines server side character encoding scheme.  Finally, domain 
names in DNS request from clients are converted to this encoding
and forwarded to mDNS'nized DNS server.
.PP
example:
.RS
server-translation . UTF-8
.RE
.RE
.IP "user-id <Name-or-ID>"
.RS
Defines a user ID in which dnsproxy operates.
Dnsproxy tries to change the user ID of its process to the specified one,
soon after initialization.
.PP
example:
.RS
.nf
user-id\ \ nobody
user-id\ \ 9999
.fi
.RE
.PP
It is strongly recommended to use this option for security reasons.
.RE
.IP "group-id <Name-or-ID>"
.RS
Defines a group ID in which dnsproxy operates.
Dnsproxy tries to change the group ID of its process to the specified one,
soon after initialization.
.PP
example:
.RS
.nf
group-id\ \ nobody
group-id\ \ 9999
.fi
.RE
.RE
.IP "root-directory <Directory>"
.RS
Defines the pathname of the root directory for the dnsproxy process.
Dnsproxy performs chroot() to set the specified directory as the
root directory for the process after initialization.
.PP
example:
.RS
.nf
root-directory /var/dnsproxy
.fi
.RE
.RE
.IP "log-level <Level>"
.RS
Sets the log level.  Available levels are ``none'' (no logging at all),
``fatal'' (only logs fatal errors), ``warn'' (also logs warning messages)
and ``trace'' (also includes trace level messages).  The default level is
``warn''.  Please note that if you set the level to ``trace'', the size of
the log file grows quickly.
.RE

.SH NOTES
Some applications locally mangles domain names.  In those cases,
dnsproxy cannot works correctly.
.PP
For 'nslookup', it generally reject non-ascii domain names.
You need 8bit through patched version of nslookup.
.PP
For UNIX resolver generally rejects domain names using non-ascii characters.
You need 8bit through patched version of resolver.
.PP
For Windows, NS works well with dnsproxy.  For IE, turn off "use UTF-8"
setting, and generally works.  But for IE, embedded URL's in page will
converted by IE (to page's original encoding),
and they conflict with dnsproxy.
