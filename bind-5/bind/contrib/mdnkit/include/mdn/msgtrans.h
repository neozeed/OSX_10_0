 * If 'use_local_rule' is true, 'local_rule' will be used for

 * the rule to determine the ZLD and codeset, and set 'local_zld'
 * and 'local_converter' properly upon return.
 *
 * Otherwise, 'mdn_msgtrans_translate' will assume that specified

 *     specified by 'local_converter', or
 *   + the one without ZLD and made of only legitimate characters
 *     (alphabets, digits and hyphens), that is, a non-internationalized
 *     domain name.
 *
 * If 'local_alt_converter' is not NULL, 'mdn_msgtrans_translate' tries
 * converting the specified domain name using it before attempting
 * 'local_conerter'.
 *
 * 'target_conveter' and 'target_zld' together define the ZLD/codeset
 * of the target.  If 'target_alt_converter' is not NULL, then it is
 * used instead of 'target_converter' if the conversion from UTF-8 to
 * the target encoding fails with error 'mdn_nomapping'.
