 * ZLD matcher.
 *
 * This module provides a function that takes a domain name as input,
 * and matches against set of ZLDs.
 *
 * Each ZLD has its corresponding codeset (character encoding), or codesets
 * in which a domain name with the ZLD is encoded.
 *
 * The function returns the matched ZLD and the corresponding codeset.
 *
 * If a name matches more than one ZLDs, the longer one takes precedence.
 *
 * If matched ZLD has more than one codesets, each codeset is applied to
 * the given domain name in order, and the first one for which the name
 * is valid is chosen.
