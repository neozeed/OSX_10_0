19. BIND 4.9.5 T6B integrated.

18. Fix "qdcount assumed to be 1" and "soa compare used strcmp" in tools/dig.c.

17. a new directive in named.boot, "source-port PORT#", will set the port 
    number for this.  the default is "0" which causes the kernel to assign one
    at random from the range above 1024.  for firewall designers in need of a
    fixed port number we suggest "42", after doug adams and IEN 116.

16. a new directive in named.boot, "source-addr DOTTEDQUAD", will set
    the source address of forwarded and recursive queries emanating from this
    server.  the default is 0.0.0.0, which tells the kernel to always use the
    address of the outbound interface.  127.0.0.1 is not allowed here.

15. a new directive in named.boot, "logging", controls specific syslogs that
    are not widely seen as useful.  "logging lame-delegations" will enable
    logging of remote server configuration errors, for those who care.

14. LAME_DELEGATION is no longer optional.  LAME_LOGGING is gone; the hardwired
    logging priority of a lame delegation message is LOG_INFO.

13. the wildcard address is no longer listened on, only interface addresses.

12. added "listen-on" directive to named.boot.

11. ns_sort.c is gone.  Servers don't sort responses, resolvers do.

10. db_reload.c removed, its last function was merged into ns_maint.c.

9. RR types T_UNSPEC, T_UID, T_GID, and T_UINFO are gone.

8. "make links" is now done by each Makefile, not just the top one.

7. eventlib vastly cleaned up and reorganized.

6. now using SIGILL in preference to the nonstandard SIGIOT/SIGABRT

5. moved tree.c, dmalloc.c to ../lib/isc/.  removed storage.c.

4. added new file ns_xfr.c.  named now uses eventlib.

3. added "-w" option to named.  converted named to use getopt().

2. DATUMREFCNT, NO_GLUE, CLEANCACHE, PURGE_ZONE, GEN_AXFR
   are no longer optional.

1. INVQ, LOCALDOM, VALIDATE and ALLOW_UPDATES, ALLOW_T_UNSPEC are gone.
