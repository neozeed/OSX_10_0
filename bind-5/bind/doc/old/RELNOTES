Release Notes
BIND 4.9.4-T1A
February 23, 1996
Paul Vixie, ISC

Shared library resolvers are currently broken.  I've changed the way system
specific libraries are handled, but it's not finished yet and does not work.
Note that I'm not sure the current SYSTYPE's are at the right granularity.
Talk to me before you go in and start fixing things, please!

There's a new directive in named.boot called "listen-on".  It takes a list
of interface addresses.  Multiple directives aggregate naturally.  If any of
these directives are specified, the resulting list limits the list of
interfaces to which BIND will bind() sockets at startup.
