     The ddnnssqquueerryy program is a general interface to nameservers via BIND re-
     solver library calls.  The program supports queries to the nameserver
     with an opcode of QUERY.  This program is intended to be a replacement or
     supplement to programs like nstest, nsquery and nslookup.  All arguments
     except for _h_o_s_t and _n_a_m_e_s_e_r_v_e_r are treated without case-sensitivity.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
     --nn _n_a_m_e_s_e_r_v_e_r
                 The nameserver to be used in the query.  Nameservers can ap-
                 pear as either Internet addresses of the form _w_._x_._y_._z or can
                 appear as domain names.  (Default: as specified in
                 _/_e_t_c_/_r_e_s_o_l_v_._c_o_n_f.)

     --tt _t_y_p_e     The type of resource record of interest.  Types include:
                       _A        address
                       _N_S       nameserver
                       _C_N_A_M_E    canonical name
                       _P_T_R      domain name pointer
                       _S_O_A      start of authority
                       _W_K_S      well-known service
                       _H_I_N_F_O    host information
                       _M_I_N_F_O    mailbox information
                       _M_X       mail exchange
                       _R_P       responsible person
                       _M_G       mail group member
                       _A_F_S_D_B
                                DCE or AFS server
                       _A_N_Y      wildcard

                 Note that any case may be used.  (Default: _A_N_Y.)

     --cc _c_l_a_s_s    The class of resource records of interest.  Classes include:
                       _I_N       Internet
                       _H_S       Hesiod
                       _C_H_A_O_S    Chaos
                       _A_N_Y      wildcard

                 Note that any case may be used.  (Default: _I_N.)

     --rr _r_e_t_r_y    The number of times to retry if the nameserver is not re-
                 sponding.  (Default:  4.)

     --pp _p_e_r_i_o_d   Period to wait before timing out.  (Default: RES_TIMEOUT.)

     --dd          Turn on debugging.  This sets the RES_DEBUG bit of the re-
                 solver's _o_p_t_i_o_n_s field.  (Default:  no debugging.)

     --ss          Use a _s_t_r_e_a_m rather than a packet.  This uses a TCP stream
                 connection with the nameserver rather than a UDP datagram.
                 This sets the RES_USEVC bit of the resolver's _o_p_t_i_o_n_s field.
                 (Default:  UDP datagram.)



     --vv          Synonym for the ``--ss'' flag.

     _h_o_s_t        The name of the host (or domain) of interest.

FFIILLEESS
     /etc/resolv.conf    to get the default ns and search lists
     <arpa/nameser.h>
                         list of usable RR types and classes
     <resolv.h>
                         list of resolver flags

DDIIAAGGNNOOSSTTIICCSS
     If the resolver fails to answer the query and debugging has not been
     turned on, ddnnssqquueerryy will simply print a message like:
           Query failed (rc = 1): Unknown host

     The value of the return code is supplied by _h___e_r_r_n_o _.

BBUUGGSS
     Queries of a class other than _I_N can have interesting results since ordi-
     narily a nameserver only has a list of root nameservers for class _I_N re-
     source records.

     DDnnssqquueerryy uses a call to iinneett__aaddddrr() to determine if the argument for the
     ``--nn'' option is a valid Internet address.  Unfortunately, iinneett__aaddddrr()
     seems to cause a segmentation fault with some (bad) IP addresses (e.g.,
     1.2.3.4.5).
