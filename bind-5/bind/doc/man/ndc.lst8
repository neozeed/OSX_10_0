     nnddcc - name daemon control program

     nnddcc [--cc _c_h_a_n_n_e_l] [--ll _l_o_c_a_l_s_o_c_k] [--pp _p_i_d_f_i_l_e] [--dd] [--qq] [--ss] [--tt]
         [_c_o_m_m_a_n_d]

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     This command allows the system administrator to control the operation of
     a name server.  If no _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is given, nnddcc will prompt for commands un-
     til it reads EOF.

     Options are:

     --cc _c_h_a_n_n_e_l  Specifies the rendezvous point for the control channel.  The
                 default is _/_v_a_r_/_r_u_n_/_n_d_c (a UNIX domain socket which is also
                 the server's default control channel).  If the desired con-
                 trol channel is a TCP/IP socket, then the format of the
                 _c_h_a_n_n_e_l argument is iippaaddddrr//ppoorrtt (for example, 112277..00..00..11//5544
                 would be TCP port 54 on the local host.)

     --ll _l_o_c_a_l_s_o_c_k
                 This option will bind(2) the client side of the control chan-
                 nel to a specific address.  Servers can be configured to re-
                 ject connections which do not come from specific addresses.
                 The format is the same as for _c_h_a_n_n_e_l (see above).

     --pp _p_i_d_f_i_l_e  For backward compatibility with older name servers, nnddcc is
                 able to use UNIX signals for control communications.  This
                 capability is optional in modern name servers and will disap-
                 pear altogether at some future time.  Note that the available
                 _c_o_m_m_a_n_d set is narrower when the signal interface is used.  A
                 likely _p_i_d_f_i_l_e argument would be something like
                 _/_v_a_r_/_r_u_n_/_n_a_m_e_d_._p_i_d.

     --dd          Turns on debugging output, which is of interest mainly to de-
                 velopers.

     --qq          Suppresses prompts and result text.

     --ss          Suppresses nonfatal error announcements.

     --tt          Turns on protocol and system tracing, useful in installation
                 debugging.

CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS
     Several commands are built into nnddcc, but the full set of commands sup-
     ported by the name server is dynamic and should be discovered using the
     _h_e_l_p command (see below).  Builtin commands are:

     _/_h_e_l_p       Provides help for builtin commands.

     _/_e_x_i_t       Exit from nnddcc command interpreter.

     _/_t_r_a_c_e      Toggle tracing (see ----tt description above).

     _/_d_e_b_u_g      Toggle debugging (see --dd description above).

     _/_q_u_i_e_t      Toggle quietude (see --qq description above).

     _/_s_i_l_e_n_t     Toggle silence (see --ss description above).

NNOOTTEESS
     If running in _p_i_d_f_i_l_e mode, any arguments to _s_t_a_r_t and _r_e_s_t_a_r_t commands
     are passed to the new nnaammeedd on its command line.  If running in _c_h_a_n_n_e_l
     mode, there is no _s_t_a_r_t command and the _r_e_s_t_a_r_t command just tells the
     name server to execvp(2) itself.
