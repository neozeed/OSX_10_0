     DDiigg (domain information groper) is a flexible command line tool which can
     be used to gather information from the Domain Name System servers.  DDiigg
     has two modes: simple interactive mode for a single query, and batch mode
     which executes a query for each in a list of several query lines. All
     query options are accessible from the command line.

     The usual simple use of ddiigg will take the form:

                 ddiigg @@_s_e_r_v_e_r _d_o_m_a_i_n _q_u_e_r_y_-_t_y_p_e _q_u_e_r_y_-_c_l_a_s_s

     where:

     _s_e_r_v_e_r      may be either a domain name or a dot-notation Internet ad-
                 dress. If this optional field is omitted, ddiigg will attempt to
                 use the default name server for your machine.

                 _N_o_t_e_: If a domain name is specified, this will be resolved
                 using the domain name system resolver (i.e., BIND). If your
                 system does not support DNS, you may _h_a_v_e to specify a dot-
                 notation address.  Alternatively, if there is a server at
                 your disposal somewhere,  all that is required is that
                 _/_e_t_c_/_r_e_s_o_l_v_._c_o_n_f be present and indicate where the default
                 name servers reside,  so that _s_e_r_v_e_r itself can be resolved.
                 See resolver(5) for information on _/_e_t_c_/_r_e_s_o_l_v_._c_o_n_f. WWAARRNNIINNGG::
                 Changing _/_e_t_c_/_r_e_s_o_l_v_._c_o_n_f will affect both the standard re-
                 solver library and (potentially) several programs which use
                 it.  As an option, the user may set the environment variable
                 LOCALRES to name a file which is to be used instead of
                 _/_e_t_c_/_r_e_s_o_l_v_._c_o_n_f standard resolver (LOCALRESis specific to
                 the ddiigg resolver and  is  not  referenced  by  the). If the
                 LOCALRES variable is not set or the specified file is not
                 readable, then _/_e_t_c_/_r_e_s_o_l_v_._c_o_n_f will be used.

     _d_o_m_a_i_n      is the domain name for which you are requesting information.
                 See the --xx option (documented in the _O_T_H_E_R _O_P_T_I_O_N_S subsection
                 of this section) for convenient way to specify inverse ad-
                 dress query.

     _q_u_e_r_y_-_t_y_p_e  is the type of information (DNS query type) that you are re-
                 questing. If omitted, the default is ``_a'' (T_A = _a_d_d_r_e_s_s).
                 The following types are recognized:

                 _a       T_A        network address
                 _a_n_y     T_ANY      all/any information about specified domain
                 _m_x      T_MX       mail exchanger for the domain
                 _n_s      T_NS       name servers
                 _s_o_a     T_SOA      zone of authority record
                 _h_i_n_f_o   T_HINFO    host information
                 _a_x_f_r    T_AXFR     zone transfer (must ask an authoritative
                                    server)
                 _t_x_t     T_TXT      arbitrary number of strings



                 (See RFC 1035 for the complete list.)

     _q_u_e_r_y_-_c_l_a_s_s
                 is the network class requested in the query. If omitted, the
                 default is ``_i_n'' (C_IN = _I_n_t_e_r_n_e_t). The following classes
                 are recognized:

                 _i_n      C_IN       Internet class domain
                 _a_n_y     C_ANY      all/any class information

                 (See RFC 1035 for the complete list.)

                 _N_o_t_e_: ``_A_n_y'' can be used to specify a _c_l_a_s_s and/or a _t_y_p_e of
                 query.  DDiigg will parse the first occurrence of ``_a_n_y'' to
                 mean _q_u_e_r_y_-_t_y_p_e _= T_ANY. To specify _q_u_e_r_y_-_c_l_a_s_s _= C_ANY, you
                 must either specify ``any'' twice, or set _q_u_e_r_y_-_c_l_a_s_s using
                 the --cc option (see below).

     %_i_g_n_o_r_e_d_-_c_o_m_m_e_n_t
                 ``%'' is used to included an argument that is simply not
                 parsed.  This may be useful  if running ddiigg in batch mode.
                 Instead of resolving every _@_s_e_r_v_e_r_-_d_o_m_a_i_n_-_n_a_m_e in a list of
                 queries, you can avoid the overhead of doing so, and still
                 have the domain name on the command line as a reference. Ex-
                 ample:

                             ddiigg @@112288..99..00..3322 %%vveenneerraa..iissii..eedduu mmxx iissii..eedduu

     --<_d_i_g _o_p_t_i_o_n>
                 ``--'' is used to specify an option which affects the opera-
                 tion of ddiigg. The following options are currently available
                 (although not guaranteed to be useful):

                 --xx _d_o_t_-_n_o_t_a_t_i_o_n_-_a_d_d_r_e_s_s
                             Convenient form to specify inverse address map-
                             ping.  Instead of ``ddiigg 3322..00..99..112288..iinn--
                             aaddddrr..aarrppaa'', one can simply ``ddiigg --xx
                             112288..99..00..3322''.

                 --ff _f_i_l_e     File for ddiigg batch mode. The file contains a list
                             of query specifications ( ddiigg command lines)
                             which are to be executed successively.  Lines be-
                             ginning with `;', `#', or `\n' are ignored.  Oth-
                             er options may still appear on command line, and
                             will be in effect for each batch query.

                 --TT _t_i_m_e     Time in seconds between start of successive
                             queries when running in batch mode. Can be used
                             to keep two or more batch ddiigg commands running
                             roughly in sync.  Default is zero.

                 --pp _p_o_r_t     Port number. Query a name server listening to a
                             non-standard port number.  Default is 53.

                 --PP[_p_i_n_g_-_s_t_r_i_n_g]
                             After query returns, execute a ping(8) command
                             for response time comparison.  This rather unele-
                             gantly makes a call to the shell.  The last three
                             lines of statistics is printed for the command:

                                         ppiinngg --ss --sseerrvveerr__nnaammee --5566 --33

                             If the optional ``_p_i_n_g___s_t_r_i_n_g'' is present, it

                             replaces ``ppiinngg --ss'' in the shell command.

                 --tt _q_u_e_r_y_-_t_y_p_e
                             Specify type of query.  May specify either an in-
                             teger value to be included in the type field or
                             use the abbreviated mnemonic as discussed above
                             (i.e., _m_x _= T_MX).

                 --cc _q_u_e_r_y_-_c_l_a_s_s
                             Specify class of query. May specify either an in-
                             teger value to be included in the class field or
                             use the abbreviated mnemonic as discussed above
                             (i.e., in = C_IN).

                 --kk _k_e_y_d_i_r_:_k_e_y_n_a_m_e
                             Sign the query with the TSIG key named keyname
                             that is in the directory keydir.

                 --eennvvssaavv     This flag specifies that the ddiigg environment (de-
                             faults, print options, etc.), after all of the
                             arguments are parsed, should be saved to a file
                             to become the default environment.  This is use-
                             ful if you do not like the standard set of de-
                             faults and do not desire to include a large num-
                             ber of options each time ddiigg is used.  The envi-
                             ronment consists of resolver state variable
                             flags, timeout, and retries as well as the flags
                             detailing ddiigg output (see below).  If the shell
                             environment variable LOCALDEF is set to the name
                             of a file, this is where the default ddiigg environ-
                             ment is saved.  If not, the file ``_D_i_G_._e_n_v'' is
                             created in the current working directory.

                             _N_o_t_e_: LOCALDEF is specific to the ddiigg resolver,
                             and will not affect operation of the standard re-
                             solver library.

                             Each time ddiigg is executed, it looks for
                             ``_._/_D_i_G_._e_n_v'' or the file specified by the shell
                             environment variable LOCALDEF. If such file ex-
                             ists and is readable, then the environment is re-
                             stored from this file before any arguments are
                             parsed.

                 --eennvvsseett     This flag only affects batch query runs. When
                             ``--eennvvsseett'' is specified on a line in a ddiigg batch
                             file, the ddiigg environment after the arguments are
                             parsed becomes the default environment for the
                             duration of the batch file, or until the next
                             line which specifies ``--eennvvsseett''.

                 --[nnoo] ssttiicckk
                             This flag only affects batch query runs.  It
                             specifies that the ddiigg environment (as read ini-
                             tially or set by ``--eennvvsseett'' switch) is to be re-
                             stored before each query (line) in a ddiigg batch
                             file.  The default ``--nnoossttiicckk'' means that the
                             ddiigg environment does not stick, hence options
                             specified on a single line in a ddiigg batch file
                             will remain in effect for subsequent lines (i.e.
                             they are not restored to the ``sticky'' default).

     ++<_q_u_e_r_y_-_o_p_t_i_o_n>
                 ``+'' is used to specify an option to be changed in the query
                 packet or to change ddiigg output specifics. Many of these are
                 the same parameters accepted by nslookup(8).  If an option
                 requires a parameter, the form is as follows:

                             ++ _k_e_y_w_o_r_d [=_v_a_l_u_e]

                 Most keywords can be abbreviated.  Parsing of the ``+'' op-
                 tions  is very  simplistic -- a value must not be separated
                 from its keyword by white space. The following keywords are
                 currently available:

                 The rreettrryy and ttiimmee options affect the retransmission strategy
                 used by the resolver library when sending datagram queries.
                 The algorithm is as follows:

                       for i = 0 to retry - 1
                           for j = 1 to num_servers
                               send_query
                               wait((time * (2**i)) / num_servers)
                           end
                       end

                 (Note: ddiigg always uses a value of 1 for ``num_servers''.)

   DDEETTAAIILLSS
     DDiigg once required a slightly modified version of the BIND resolver(3) li-
     brary.  As of BIND 4.9, BIND's resolver has been augmented to work prop-
     erly with ddiigg. Essentially, ddiigg is a straight-forward (albeit not pretty)
     effort of parsing arguments and setting appropriate parameters.  DDiigg uses
     resolver(3) routines rreess__iinniitt(), rreess__mmkkqquueerryy(), rreess__sseenndd() as well as ac-
     cessing the ___r_e_s structure.

BBUUGGSS
     DDiigg has a serious case of "creeping featurism" -- the result of consider-
     ing several potential uses during it's development.  It would probably
     benefit from a rigorous diet.  Similarly, the print flags and granularity
     of the items they specify make evident their rather ad hoc genesis.

     DDiigg does not consistently exit nicely (with appropriate status) when a
     problem occurs somewhere in the resolver (NNOOTTEE::most of the common exit
     cases are handled). This is particularly annoying when running in batch
     mode.  If it exits abnormally (and is not caught), the entire batch
     aborts; when such an event is trapped, ddiigg simply continues with the next
     query.
