     NNaammeedd--xxffeerr is an ancillary program executed by named(8) to perform an in-
     bound zone transfer.  It is rarely executed directly, and then only by
     system administrators who are trying to debug a zone transfer problem.
     See RFC's 1033, 1034, and 1035 for more information on the Internet name-
     domain system.

     Options are:

     --zz _z_o_n_e___t_o___t_r_a_n_s_f_e_r
                 specifies the name of the zone to be transferred.

     --ff _d_b___f_i_l_e  specifies the name of the _d_b___f_i_l_e into which the zone should
                 be dumped when it is received from the primary server.

     --ss _s_e_r_i_a_l___n_o
                 specifies the serial number of our current copy of this zone.
                 If the SSOOAA RRRR we get from the primary server does not have a
                 serial number higher than this, the transfer will be aborted.

     --dd _d_e_b_u_g_l_e_v_e_l
                 Print debugging information.  The _d_e_b_u_g_l_e_v_e_l is a number de-
                 termines the level of messages printed.

     --ll _d_e_b_u_g___l_o_g___f_i_l_e
                 Specifies a log file for debugging messages.  The default is
                 system- dependent but is usually in _/_v_a_r_/_t_m_p or _/_u_s_r_/_t_m_p.
                 Note that this only applies if ``--dd'' is also specified.

     --ii _i_x_f_r___f_i_l_e
                 Specifies the name of the _i_x_f_r___f_i_l_e into which the zone
                 changes from Incremental Zone Transfer (IXFR) should be
                 dumped when it is received from the primary server.

     --tt _t_r_a_c_e___f_i_l_e
                 Specifies a _t_r_a_c_e___f_i_l_e which will contain a protocol trace of
                 the zone transfer.  This is probably only of interest to peo-
                 ple debugging the name server itself.

     --pp _p_o_r_t_#    Use a different port number.  The default is the standard
                 port number as returned by getservbyname(3) for the service
                 ``domain''.

     --SS          Perform a restricted transfer of only the SOA, NS records and
                 glue A records for the zone. The SOA record will not be load-
                 ed by named(8) but will be used to determine when to verify
                 the NS records.  See the ``stubs'' directive in named(8) for
                 more information.

     Additional arguments are taken as name server addresses in so-called
     ``dotted-quad'' syntax _o_n_l_y_; no host name are allowed here.  At least one
     address must be specified.  Any additional addresses will be tried, in
     order, if the first one fails to transfer to us successfully.  The aaxxffrr
     or iixxffrr after name server address designates the type of zone transfer to
     perform.  Use aaxxffrr for a full zone transfer or iixxffrr for an incremental
     zone transfer.
