	Windows NT BIND 8.2.3 builds:

Date:22-Nov-2000

Before you build BIND:
**********************

  Make sure you run the perl script makeversion.pl located in the port\winnt
  directory from the command line.  This script takes the version.c file
  from /src/bin/named and applies version information and builder data
  to the file and places the resulting file in the port\winnt\named directory.
  If you don't have perl, you can get it from http://www.ActiveState.com/
  which supplies a free version of perl for win32 systems.  If you don't
  wish to install perl on your system you will have to edit the version.c
  file by hand and replace all of the variables yourself, using the Version
  file located at the top of the tree (/src) and adding the date, location
  etc. information.  This file MUST be placed in port/winnt/named in order
  to compile the source code.  If you package the binaries in a kit, please
  include the readme1st.txt file for the full kit and readme1sttools.txt
  if you are packaging just the tools.  These files contain installation
  and usage information. Note: the tools require the libbind.dll Library
  in order to run so a tools package requires libbind.dll.  The tools will
  NOT run on Win9x, only WinNT and Win2000.


If you have an old beta of 8.2.2 (pre-T8B):
*******************************************

- Be sure there are no DLL files in the BIND bin directory 
  (c:\winnt\system32\dns\bin).  BIND DLLs are placed in the System32 directory 
  now, and BIND will not work if you have old DLLs hanging around.

To build BIND:
**************

The makefiles included are generated by VC++ 6.0. 

Command Line:
In src/port/winnt, execute "<your_make_util> named.mak [Debug|Release]".
All targets are built into /src/port/winnt/bin/[Debug|Release].

From Visual Studio:
VC++ 6.0 project files are under src/port/winnt/named, src/port/winnt/xfer, 
src/port/winnt/libbind, src/port/winnt/bindevt, src/port/winnt/BINDCtrl, and 
src/port/winnt/BINDInstall

Build each one - they target into src/port/winnt/bin.
Recommend that you use Build->Batch Build and select the Release or Debug versions 
of each project.

(Check known issues before you build Release versions)

A VC++ 6.0 workspace containing all seven projects is in src/port/winnt/named.

Executables in this package
src/port/winnt/named - named.exe
src/port/winnt/xfer - named-xfer.exe
src/port/winnt/libbind - libbind.dll
src/port/winnt/bindevt - bindevt.dll (event log format strings)
src/port/winnt/BINDCtrl - BINDCtrl.exe (BIND service control panel)
src/port/winnt/BINDInstall - BINDInstall.exe (BIND installer)
src/port/winnt/nsupdate - nsupdate utility.

After compiling, run BINDInstall.exe from /src/port/winnt/bin/[Debug|Release]
BINDInstall will also install itself in the same directory as named.
You can also use it to uninstall BIND.

You can control named using BINDCtrl located in the same directory as the
installed files: Systems32\dns\bin.  This is a replacement for ndc which
is used on Unix systems.

Building the Tools
******************

The tools have to be built separately and have their own project/mak files.
There is one for each of dig, nslookup and host.  libbind.dll must be
built before these tools as they use the libbind.lib file to link.

Executables for the Tools
src/port/winnt/dig - dig.exe
src/port/winnt/nslookup - nslookup.exe
src/port/winnt/host - host.exe

Known Issues
************
- none
