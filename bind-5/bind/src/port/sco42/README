Preliminary port of BIND 8.1 to SCO 3.2v4.2 (ODT 3.0).

As of 13-Mar-97, it does compile and link on SCO 3.2v4.2, but some
tricks are required. My solution will be not to explain these tricks
in detail, but have shell script in this directory to drive the build
process on SCO 3.2v4.2.

Modification history:

Date	  Who	What
====	  ===	====

03-Feb-97 E.V.	Eduard Vopicka, <eda@vse.cz>
		Initial work. Performs some basic functions, but
		mostly untested.
15-Feb-97 E.V.	Fixed pathnames to better emulate SCO's named mimics.
		Still untested in real life.
13-Mar-97 E.V.	Lots of problems fixed and lots of things re-done.
		Just it runs on one of our secondaries for about 24
		hours.
10-Apr-97 E.V.	moved *.sh to tools. Improved percentp.sh - thanks
		to Bela Lubkin for suggestions.
01-May-97 E.V.	Added BIND_4_COMPAT to include/port_after.h

		NOTE: The last 3.2v4.2 based system I have access to
		will be upgraded to SCO OSE 5.0.2 in the next week or
		two. This de facto means that I will be no longer able
		to maintain this port. As of T3B, this port worked well
		on our secondary DNS machine, running also sendmail
		8.8.5 linked with the updated (with 8.1 resolver
		modules) libsocket.so.		Good luck, E.V.
