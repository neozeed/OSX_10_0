IRIX port by David Lindes, originally based on the solaris port:

NOTE: The latest information on the IRIX port of BIND can be
found on the web at:

http://www.daveltd.com/bind-irix-port/

Please check there for relevant notes, but I'll try to duplicate
things here.  (Just be warned that you may have an old copy of
this file.)


Current status for various versions of IRIX:

	builds without any warnings on IRIX 5.3
	builds with ld warnings only on IRIX 6.2
	builds with numerous warnings on IRIX 6.4
	builds with ld and uopt warnings on IRIX 6.5


Other known issues:

-	the 'install' command in IRIX is not compatible with
	other 'install' programs.  If you have the x_dev.sw.binaries
	inst(1M) image (from the IDO) installed, there is a
	'bsdinst' command that is compatible, and which this
	distribution will attempt to use.
	

	Otherwise, you will need to get a version of 'install'
	that is compatible, and update the file
	port/irix/Makefile.set to point to the right place.

	(Install comes from the X11 distribution, and is also
	available from the 'sh-utils' GNU package as install-sh,
	among other places.)

-       If you use the environment variable 'CDPATH', it will
	cause first round makes to fail.  Try unsetting this
	variable, or setting it to null.

	(i.e. use: `make CDPATH=""`).

-	At least in IRIX 5.3 and 6.2, 'make' won't work with a
	a shell that's not bourne-shell compatible as your
	"SHELL" environment variable.  Try running make with
	SHELL set to /bin/sh (e.g. `make SHELL=/bin/sh`).

-	BIND will not listen on IP aliased IP addresses in IRIX.
	I've got ideas for a fix on this, but I haven't had the
	time to make it happen.
