These are a few of ISC's local config files.
Use them as templates or idea-generators.
No warranty expressed or implied.

workstation/

	this is what we run on most workstations in our main development
	facility.  there are local zones for LOCALHOST and 127.IN-ADDR.ARPA,
	which means X11's "localhost:0" works even when the LAN is down.
	there's a current (as of june 1999) set of root hints, so we can
	reach the internet's name servers.  and there's a set of stubs for
	our building nets and domains so that we can still reach the local
	NFS and other servers when the WAN is down.

recursive/

	this is for a LAN resolver, which is one of multiple name servers
	running on the same host (each with its own lo0 alias address).  it
	has more or less what workstation/ (see above) has plus some stubs
	for our RFC1918 addresses, some stubs for our PAIX networks, and a
	shell script called "keep-running" that will restart named after a
	small delay if it should happen to run out of memory and dump core.
	(we're not using it on this host at this time, but we have used it.)
