To integrate BIND into a 4.4BSD or 4.4BSD-Lite system, you need to perform the
following steps.  You might be doing this if you are maintaining one of the
BNR2- or 4.4L-based BSD's (BSD/OS, FreeBSD, NetBSD), or if you are running
4.4BSD and you want to get the newest BIND cleanly integrated into it.

1. Apply the diffs in Diffs/lib-libc-net to your lib/libc/net tree, and
   apply the diffs in Diffs/include(*) to your include tree.  These are roughly
   the changes that will appear in 4.4BSD-Lite++ so you're on the right track.

2. Rid your system of all vestiges of named, named-xfer, dig, nslookup, or the
   utility scripts, named.reload and named.restart.  Don't forget to update the
   parent directory Makefiles when you remove source directories.

3. Unpack the BIND kit, or move the one you have already unpacked, to someplace
   like contrib/BIND in your tree (which might or might not be /usr/src).

4. Move, or preferrably copy, the contrib/BIND/BSD directory to some place like
   usr.sbin/named or usr.bin/bind or whatever pleases you.  Update the parent
   directory's Makefile to include this new directory.

5. In usr.sbin/named (or whatever you chose in #4), remove the BIND symlink and
   make a new one pointing to ../../contrib/BIND (or whatever you chose in #3).

6. Do the dance that makes and installs includes, libraries, and utilities.  It
   is safe (and recommended) to use "make obj" and "make depend" on the subtree
   that includes this integration of BIND.

7. Watch comp.protocols.tcp-ip.domains and/or the bind@uunet.uu.net mailing
   list for patches and updates to BIND.  When new kits are made available,
   grab them and repeat these instructions (or, if you are brave, diff things
   and apply patches by hand).

This package has been brought to you by the Internet Software Consortium.

(*) no 4.4BSD-Lite include diffs are available yet, use your own judgement and
do the merge on your own.
