- Add notification registration.

High priority:

- Need command line means for bringing up the system to a certain service.
  In particular, in single-user, one should be able to bring up the
  network easily.

- Need to encompass the role of /etc/rc*.

- CoreGraphics code should load as a plugin, rather than compile into the
  base program.

Medium priority:

- Convert items to include UI feedback for errors, etc.

- Implement dyld bundles as an alternative to executables.

Low priority:

- Figure out a way for non-loadable items (scripts and excecutable binaries)
  to have some UI feedback.

- Get the running status of a service without having run it in SystemStarter.
  This is useful for properly re-running SystemStarter and implementing stop.

- Implement stop and restart.

- Search /Network when available.

- Make alternate display implementations loadable.
