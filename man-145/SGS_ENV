# SGS_ENV file for version roots
#
# This SGS_ENV file should exist in the version root
# of all version trees.  It will normally be placed in
# the master version root and be cloned to all development
# versions.
#
# BASIC definitions for the SGS tools
#
# The MASTER USER for this project.
#	The master versions of the project software reside
#	in the master user's tree and are owned by the master user.
#
# The PROJECT_NAME for this project.
#	The project name is used searching either the master's or
#	developer's home/SGS_ENV files to determine the project
#	root or the list of project developers (see ~osdev/SGS_ENV)

# DONT_DIFF is an egrep(1) pattern which should match all files that

# cross(1) definitions
#
# These definitions control the behavior of the cross development
# tool cross(1)
#
# SGS_VERBOSE says "echo all `translated' commands"
# SGS_PATH is the path to search if a command which is linked to
# cross(1) does not have a definition in this SGS_ENV file (i.e.
# this is how to find the native version)

# LCLINC specifies local directories to prepend to the include files
# search path.  ${LCLROOT} is defined in NeXT_ENV as ~/NeXT_root, and
# is intended to be used as the base destination of the "local" makefile
# target.  LCLROOT can then be used as a "pre-install" test area for
# local builds.
#
# NOTE: Eventually, we should have /usr/include/bsd and /usr/include/mach
# rather /usr/mach/include.
