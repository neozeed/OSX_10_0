.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nmserver
[ \fB-c\fR ] [ \fB-t\fR ] [ \fB-p\fR \fIprint_level\fR ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I network server
is the program responsible for forwarding Mach IPC over the network.
Currently, it also implements a simple network name service.
The network server should be started once and for all at boot time.
It is shared by all users of the machine.
.SH OPTIONS
.B -c
enables debugging in the
.I cthreads
library.

.B -t
enables procedure call tracing, if the executable was compiled with
this facility turned on.

.B -p
is used to set the level of debugging messages printed on the console.
Possible values for \fIprint_level\fR are 5, 3, and 0, which
correspond to LS_PRINT_NEVER, LS_PRINT_LOG, and LS_PRINT_ALWAYS
respectively.  The debugging messages become more verbose as the value
changes from LS_PRINT_NEVER to LS_PRINT_ALWAYS.
