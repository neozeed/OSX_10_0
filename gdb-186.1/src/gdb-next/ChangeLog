	* nextstep-nat-inferior.c (next_fetch_task_info): Comment out the call 
	to next_init_dyld_symfile.  This caused gdb to reset shared library
	info when quitting.
	(next_child_stop): New function: don't use child_stop, it sends
	a kill (-pid, SIGINT) which doesn't work on MacOS X unless the inferior
	actually IS a process group leader.  But apps in MacOS X almost never
	are (they are children of the WindowServer).
	
	initialize remote_async_terminal_ours_p to 1 - this reflects truth:
	gdb at startup DOES own the terminal.
	* remote-kdp.c: ditto.

2001-01-22  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	* ppc-frameinfo.c (ppc_frame_cache_properties): Check that the
	frame's extra_info is set.

2000-11-07  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	* ppc-frameinfo.c (ppc_parse_instructions): If the FIRST instruction of the
	prologue is a bl, we are probably NOT in the prologue.

	* ppc-tdep.c (ppc_frame_find_pc): In the case where we have no symbols, 
	use the instruction parser to tell us whether the return address has
	been put on the stack yet or not.

2000-09-06  Jim Ingham  <jingham@localhost>

	* nextstep-nat-inferior-util.c: add WITH_CFM guards in the
	appropriate places.
	* nextstep-nat-inferior.c: ditto
	* nextstep-nat-inferior.h: ditto.

2000-09-05  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	* ppc-frameinfo.c (ppc_parse_instructions): Cleanup a comment & remove
	an unused variable.

2000-09-01  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	* ppc-frameinfo.h: Added a few comments.

	* ppc-frameinfo.c (ppc_parse_instructions): Detect the
	"save_world" stack setup routine that gcc uses for C++, and set up
	the props structure based on what it does.  NB. This will break if
	gcc changes this routine, but there's not much I can do about
	this...

2000-08-09  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	* nextstep-nat-dyld-path.c (build_suffix_name): new function, find
	full name including the DYLD_IMAGE_SUFFIX.
	(search_for_name_in_path): Pass in the
	suffix that comes from DYLD_IMAGE_SUFFIX, and use in search.
	(get_framework_pathname): pass in flag telling whether to use
	the image suffix, and use it.
	(dyld_resolve_image): use the image suffix in resolving the image 
	path.
	(dyld_init_paths): Initialize the image_suffix from the environment.
	* nextstep-nat-dyld-path.c: Add image_suffix to dyld_path_info struct.

2000-07-20  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	* nextstep-nat-inferior-debug.c: Add fflush to the inferior_stderr.  
	There may be other places where this is needed as well, but we 
	will chase them down as we find them.

	* nextstep-nat-inferior.c: Open the inferior_stderr "w", not
	"w+", so the debugging output will work when gdb is running as
	pipe under another program.

2000-06-23  James Ingham  <jingham@inghji.apple.com>

	* nextstep-nat-dyld-process.c: Take out the call to 
	build_objfile_section_table, since it only screwed up the 
	section table, and had no other purpose...
