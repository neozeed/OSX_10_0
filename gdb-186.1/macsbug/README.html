<FONT SIZE=4><P><B>1. Introduction</B></P></FONT>
<P>
The <a href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/debuggers/MacsBug/">MacsBug</a> supported here is <a href="http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/macosx/DeveloperTools/gdb/gdb/gdb_toc.html">gdb</a>
 extended to support a subset of the Mac Classic MacsBug commands and a MacsBug-like screen UI. Thus it basically is a variant of MacsBug with source-level debugging!
</P><P>
Along with this README there are four other files in this directory:
</P>
<UL>
<LI type=square><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>gdbinit-MacsBug-without-plugin</FONT></LI>
<LI type=square><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>gdbinit-MacsBug</FONT></LI>
<LI type=square><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>MacsBug</FONT></LI>
<LI type=square><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>install-MacsBug</FONT></LI>
</UL>
<P>
Both <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>gdbinit-MacsBug-without-plugin</FONT> and <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>gdbinit-MacsBug</FONT> are gdb command language scripts one of which you <B>source</B> from your <nobr><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>~/.gdbinit</FONT></nobr> script (the script that gdb always looks for, and for what it's worth, it looks for a <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>.gdbinit</FONT> in the current directory as well). We'll explain in the following sections the difference in the two MacsBug scripts.
</P><P>
The <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>MacsBug_plugins</FONT> are just that; the gdb plugins that implement the MacsBug UI and commands. The plugin is loaded by the <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>gdbinit-MacsBug</FONT> script.
</P><P>
The <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>install-MacsBug</FONT> script is used for private installs of the MacsBug support files and/or to edit your <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>.gdbinit</FONT> script to add the proper <B>source</B> command to load MacsBug.
</P>


<p>&nbsp;</P>
<FONT SIZE=4><P><B>2. Background</B></P></FONT>
<P>
Once upon a time there was an implementation of Classic MacsBug for gdb using nothing but the command language provided by gdb. The file was called <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>gdbinit-MacsBug</FONT> (and since renamed <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>gdbinit-MacsBug-without-plugin</FONT>) and it is included with this release. It supports about 40 of the MacsBug commands.
</P><P>
It has the benefit of being totally portable, i.e., it should be able to be used with any version of gdb, on any Unix system, anywhere. It's down side is that it cannot do any more that what is provided by the rather limited gdb command language, is interpretive, and thus rather inefficient and in some cases slow, and cannot provide a MacsBug-like screen UI.
</P><P>
To get around these limitations the plugin support in Apple's gdb was utilized which allows the implementation be done in a "real" language. Thus the script <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>gdbinit-MacsBug</FONT> is provided which appears to be a very reduced form or <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>gdbinit-MacsBug-without-plugin</FONT> because most of the implementation is provided in a plugin (<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>MacsBug</FONT>) which <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>gdbinit-MacsBug</FONT> loads with a <B>load-plugin</B> Apple gdb command.
</P><P>
The benefit of using the plugins is that it is very efficient because it "talks" directly to gdb. It can provide functionality that the pure script variant cannot like some additional MacsBug commands and behavior as well as w MacsBug-like screen UI. It's down side is of course that it is tied directly to the version of gdb (and system) for which it was built. Further, because the script uses the <B>load-plugin</B> gdb command it will only work with Apple's version of gdb. Since MacsBug is mainly used by Mac developers this should be not be a serious limitation.
</P><P>
You thus have two choices:
</P>
<OL>
<LI>Install the totally portable <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>gdbinit-MacsBug-without-plugin</FONT></nobr> script, or,
</LI><LI>
Install the <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>gdbinit-MacsBug</FONT></nobr> script and the <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>MacsBug</FONT></nobr> plugin file.
</LI>
</OL>


<P>&nbsp;</P>
<FONT SIZE=4><P><B>3. Installation</B></P></FONT>
<P>
The MacsBug files are all installed in,
</P><P>
<nobr><FONT FACE="Courier"size=+0>&nbsp;
/usr/libexec/gdb/plugins/MacsBug
</FONT></nobr>
</P><P>
If you elect choice 1 then just add the following to your <nobr><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>~/.gdbinit</FONT></nobr> script:
</P><P>
<nobr><FONT FACE="Courier" size=+0>&nbsp;
source /usr/libexec/gdb/plugins/MacsBug/gdbinit-MacsBug-without-plugin
</FONT></nobr>
</P><P>
If you want to use the plugins then add the following source command instead:
</P><P>
<nobr><FONT FACE="Courier" size=+0>&nbsp;
source /usr/libexec/gdb/plugins/MacsBug/gdbinit-MacsBug
</FONT></nobr>
</P><P>
The <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>gdbinit-MacsBug</FONT> script is installed with it's <B>load-plugin</B> command defined as follows:
</P><P>
<nobr><FONT FACE="Courier" size=+0>&nbsp;
load-plugin /usr/libexec/gdb/plugins/MacsBug/MacsBug
</FONT></nobr>
</P><P>
Note that <b>load-plugin</b> commands require a full pathname and no <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>'~'</FONT>s.
</P><P>
From this point on this README assumes you are installing the plugin.
</P>


<P>&nbsp;</P>
<FONT SIZE=4><P><B>4. The "install-MacsBug" Script</B></P>
<P><nobr><B></FONT><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=-1>
install-Macsbug [<i>where</i>] [--gdbinit=<i>pathname</i>] [--v[erbose]] [--f[orce]] [--help]
</B></nobr></FONT>
</P><P>
In <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>/usr/libexec/gdb/plugins/MacsBug</FONT> the two key files needed for the MacsBug plugins are:</P>
<UL>
<LI type=square><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>
gdbinit-MacsBug
</FONT></LI>
<LI type=square><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>
MacsBug
</FONT></LI>
</UL>
<P>
The <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>gdbinit-MacsBug</FONT> file is a gdb script which, among other things, does the <b>load-plugin</b> gdb command to load the <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>MacsBug</FONT> plugin file. The <b>load-plugin</b> command requires a full pathname to the <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>MacsBug</FONT> plugin. So it is preset to load from the system MacsBug directory. The <nobr><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>~/.gdbinit</FONT></nobr> script then needs to do a <B>source</B> command to load the <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>gdbinit-MacsBug</FONT> script, again from the system directory.
</P><P>
As stated in the installation above you can explicitly edit your <nobr><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>~/.gdbinit</FONT></nobr> script to do the appropriate <b>source</b> command. Alternatively <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>install-MacsBug</FONT> can do it for you.
</P><P>
It is also possible that there may be intermediate releases of the MacsBug plugins which are compatible with your system. Intermediate releases are not expected to be placed in <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>/usr/libexec/gdb/plugins/MacsBug</FONT>. So the installer can also be used to install a newer MacsBug directory in a directory of your choosing.
</P><P>
Thus <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>install-MacsBug</FONT> does three things:
</P>
<OL>
<P><LI>
Optionally edits your <nobr><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>~/.gdbinit</FONT></nobr> script (if <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>--gdbinit</font> is specified) to create or modify a <B>source</B> command that loads <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>gdbinit-MacsBug</FONT> from a copy of the MacsBug directory or the system-installed MacsBug directory.
</LI></P>
<P><LI>
Optionally copies an entire MacsBug directory to a chosen directory (<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0><I><B>where</B></I></FONT>). The source MacsBug directory is the directory containing the <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>install-MacsBug</FONT> installer script.
</LI></P>
<P><LI>
Modifies the copied <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>gdbinit-MacsBug</FONT> <b>load-plugin</b> command to load the <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>MacsBug</FONT> plugin from the copied folder.
</LI></P>
</OL>
<P>
The parameters to <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>install-MacsBug</FONT> have the following meaning:
</P>
<DL>
<DT><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0><B><I>where</I></B></FONT></DT>
<DD>
A pathname specifying a directory which is created containing the contents of the MacsBug directory. It doesn't have to be called "MacsBug" and it need not be a "visible" directory, i.e., you could name it with a leading <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>'<B>.</B>'</FONT>.
&nbsp
The default is to <i>not</i> copy the MacsBug directory and set the <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0><B>--gdbinit</B></FONT> specified script to use the MacsBug script defined in the folder containing the <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>install-MacsBug</FONT> installer script.
</DD>
&nbsp
<DT><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0><B>--gdbinit=<I>pathname</I></B></FONT></DT>
<DD>
Optionally specifies the location of a <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>.gdbinit</FONT> file. For use in all gdb invocations this should be <nobr><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>~/.gdbinit</FONT></nobr>. If this parameter is not specified your <nobr><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>~/.gdbinit</FONT></nobr> script will <i>not</i> be modified.
&nbsp
Note, if the <nobr><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>~/.gdbinit</FONT></nobr> script is modified, the original version of the script is renamed with <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>"-bkup"</FONT> added to the filename.
</DD>
&nbsp
<DT><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0><B>--force</B></FONT></DT>
<DD>
This script checks that the <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0><i>where</i></FONT> is not in the same place from which the <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>install-MacsBug</FONT> script is running. If it is, that implies the source and destination directories are the same. In addition a check is done to see if the <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0><i>where</i></FONT> has already been installed for MacsBug. In either of these cases no further action is taken the and script terminates. Specifying <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0><B>--force</B></FONT> overrides these tests and "forces" the installation.
</DD>
&nbsp
<DT><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0><B>--verbose</B></FONT></DT>
<DD>
Script confirms what it is doing.
</DD>

<FONT SIZE=4><P><B>5. Using Gdb's HELP Commands For MacsBug</B></P></FONT>
<P>
Once gdb is loaded type <B>help</B> to see a summary of all gdb command classes. There are three additional classes for MacsBug: "macsbug", "screen", and "useful".
</P><P>
Typing <b>help macsbug</b> gives a summary of all the MacsBug commands.
</P><P>
Typing <b>help screen</b> gives a summary of all MacsBug screen UI-related commands which are additions to this MacsBug implementation.
</P><P>
Typing <b>help useful</b> gives a list of "useful" gdb commands that could be used to extend the MacsBug script or for your own gdb <B>define</B> commands. Some of these are used internally, or are plugin descendants from the original gdb script, or are just plain useful in their own right and should probably be in gdb in the first place!.
</P><P>
Two existing gdb help classes, "aliases" and "support" also list some MacsBug commands. The "aliases" class lists aliases for some commands that don't follow the standard gdb command abbreviation conventions (e.g., <b>sc6</b> is the same as <b>sc</b>). The "support" class lists the <b>set</b> options.
</P><P>
As indicated at the end of the <B>help</B> class summary you can type <b>mb-notes</b> to get some additional information specifically related to this implementation of MacsBug. These notes are also repeated in the next section.
</P><P>
Finally, also as indicated in the <B>help</B> summary, typing <B>help</B> followed by a command name displays a summary for that specific command.
</P>

<FONT SIZE=4><P><B>6. General Comments About Gdb MacsBug</B></P></FONT>
<P>
Below are a list of some general notes about the Gdb MacsBug. Much of this information is also available by type "mb-notes"(or help mb-notes) into gdb.</P>
<UL>
<LI type=disc>
The MacsBug support for gdb is as faithful a simulation as possible within the limits of the environment. There are also some extensions where it makes sense in the context of the debugging paradigm imposed by gdb. Also a MacsBug-like UI is supported (use the MB command to turn on the MacsBug screen).
</LI><P><LI type=disc>
The <i>$dot</i> gdb variable is the last address referenced by certain commands. This corresponds to Mac Classic's MacsBug <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>'<B>.</B>'</FONT> variable. For example, <b>sm</b> sets <i>$dot</i> to the first address that was changed. The default for many commands is to use <i>$dot</i> as their address argument. Typing <b>dm</b> will display the memory just set and set the last command to <b>dm</b>. A return after the parameterless <b>dm</b> command will use the <i>$dot</i> set by it to display then next block of memory in sequence. Note that this is the normal MacsBug behavior but that is different from gdb which would repeat the last command.
</LI></P><P><LI type=disc>
The <i>$colon</i> gdb variable is the address of the start of the proc containing the current PC when the target is running.
</LI></P><P><LI type=disc>
Only C/C++ can be debugged since the gdb commands use C/C++ syntax for their implementation (restriction imposed by this implementation's use of gdb).
</LI></P><P><LI type=disc>
Arguments are written using C/C++ syntax (e.g., use <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>-&gt;</FONT> instead of <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>^</FONT>, <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>!=</FONT> instead of <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>&lt;&gt;</FONT>, etc.).
</LI></P><P><LI type=disc>
Only one command per line allowed (gdb restriction).
</LI></P><P><LI type=disc>
Some restrictions on the commands that are supported. Do <b>help</b> on individual commands for details.
</LI></P><P><LI type=disc>
Decimal values are shown without leading <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>'#'</FONT> and hex is shown with a <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>'0x'</FONT> prefix (except in disassemblies and other displays where it's obvious it's hex).
</LI></P><P><LI type=disc>
The input radix is as defined by the gdb <b>set input-radix</b> command. The default is decimal unlike MacsBug which defaults to hex. Use the gdb command <b>show input-radix</b> to verify the input radix.
</LI></P><P><LI type=disc>
Many of the commands are not permitted until there is a target program running (using the MacsBug <b>g</b> or gdb <b>run</b> command). Most of the commands will cause some kind of error report until there is a target running. Of course with Mac Classic MacsBug there is always something running. But that's not the case with gdb.
</LI></P><P><LI type=disc>
Some of the MacsBug <b>set</b> options are supported. Use <b>help support</b> to see a summary of <b>set</b> commands. All the MacsBug <b>set</b> options start with <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>"mb-"</FONT> so you can use standard command completion (hitting tab after typing the <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>"mb"</FONT> will show you all those <b>set</b> options. For compatibility with Mac Classic MacsBug, <b>set ditto</b> and <b>set unmangle</b> are also supported.
</LI></P><P><LI type=disc>
Some Mac Classic MacsBug commands like <b>sc6</b>, <b>sc7</b>, and <b>sc</b> or <b>ilp</b> and <b>il</b> are identical in the gdb implementation. These alternatives take the form of gdb aliases. Use <b>help aliases</b> to see the supported aliases.
</LI></P><P><LI type=disc>
<b>Si</b> is defined as the MacsBug <b>s</b> command since gdb already has a <b>s</b> command. But this overrides gdb's <b>si</b> abbreviation for <b>stepi</b>.
</LI></P><P><LI type=disc>
When the MacsBug screen is being used command lines may be continued (using <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>'\'</FONT>) within the area defined for commands. The default number of lines is 2 but may be increased up to 15 using the <b>set mb-cmd-area</b> command. Continuing more than the allotted space is allowed but will cause the command lines to scroll up within their area. Unfortunately this does not happen if a command is interactively created with <b>define</b> and you try to continue one of the command's lines. The continuations are allowed. But they just don't scroll.
</LI></P><P><LI type=disc>
Unlike Mac Classic MacsBug, there is only one screen for gdb and the target program. Further, gdb has no control over output generated by the target program or caused by it (e.g., dyld messages). Thus the MacsBug screen could get "mangled". Use the <b>refresh</b> command to restore the MacsBug screen or turn off the MacsBug screen and debug with gdb's normal scroll mode. All the MacsBug commands still work in scroll mode and any commands that cause disassembly will display the current registers on the right side of the terminal screen (to minimize the affect on scroll back viewing).
</LI></P><P><LI type=disc>
A set of possibly useful commands for extending this script are available. Typing <b>help useful</b> will list those commands. You will see some output commands that write their output to stderr instead of stdout. This is only significant in the context of the MacsBug screen. When the MacsBug screen is on (<b>mb on</b>) all output goes into the history area. Output to stderr is written in <FONT color=red>red</FONT>. By convention this is be used for error reporting only.
</LI>
</UL>


<P>&nbsp;</P>
<FONT SIZE=4><P><B>7. Terminal Considerations</B></P></FONT>
<P>
Gdb MacsBug assumes it is writing to a terminal window that should be configured as follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI type=square>Xterm enabled</LI>
<LI type=square>VT100 or VT220 emulation</LI>
<LI type=square>8-bit connections</LI>
<LI type=square>Window size of at least 46 rows by 80 columns if the MacsBug screen is turned on</LI>
<LI type=square>Allows bolding of characters</LI>
<LI type=square>Supports colors red and blue</LI>
<LI type=square>Should use a mono-spaced font</LI>
<LI type=square>No translation</LI>
<LI type=square>Screen size of at least 46 rows and 80 columns if the MacsBug screen is used.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
With the exception of <b>bolding</b>, the OSX standard terminal window supports all these characteristics (use its preferences to configure for extra bolding). The only colors MacsBug uses are <FONT color=red>red</FONT> and <FONT color=blue>blue</FONT>. All other output uses the default font color.
</P><P>
Color and bolding are, of course, not a strict requirement. But Xterm, 8-bit support is. While an OSX standard terminal has no problems with these requirements you do need to verify them when using a Telenet program.
</P><P>
Finally, different terminal programs as well as the OSX terminal window itself have their own unique "quirks" and timing considerations or communication failures may mangle the display. If this should happen while the MacsBug screen is up you will need to type a <b>refresh</b> command to restore the proper display.
</P>
