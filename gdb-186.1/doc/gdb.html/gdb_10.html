<H1><A NAME="SEC63" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC63">Using GDB with Different Languages</A></H1>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX350"></A>

</P>
<P>
Although programming languages generally have common aspects, they are
rarely expressed in the same manner.  For instance, in ANSI C,
dereferencing a pointer <CODE>p</CODE> is accomplished by <CODE>*p</CODE>, but in
Modula-2, it is accomplished by <CODE>p^</CODE>.  Values can also be
represented (and displayed) differently.  Hex numbers in C appear as 
<SAMP>`0x1ae'</SAMP>, while in Modula-2 they appear as <SAMP>`1AEH'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX351"></A>
Language-specific information is built into GDB for some languages,
allowing you to express operations like the above in your program's
native language, and allowing GDB to output values in a manner
consistent with the syntax of your program's native language.  The
language you use to build expressions is called the <STRONG>working
language</STRONG>.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC64" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC64">Switching between source languages</A></H2>

<P>
There are two ways to control the working language--either have GDB
set it automatically, or select it manually yourself.  You can use the
<CODE>set language</CODE> command for either purpose.  On startup, GDB
defaults to setting the language automatically.  The working language is
used to determine how expressions you type are interpreted, how values
are printed, etc.

</P>
<P>
In addition to the working language, every source file that
GDB knows about has its own working language.  For some object
file formats, the compiler might indicate which language a particular
source file is in.  However, most of the time GDB infers the
language from the name of the file.  The language of a source file
controls whether C++ names are demangled--this way <CODE>backtrace</CODE> can
show each frame appropriately for its own language.  There is no way to
set the language of a source file from within GDB.  

</P>
<P>
This is most commonly a problem when you use a program, such
as <CODE>cfront</CODE> or <CODE>f2c</CODE>, that generates C but is written in 
another language.  In that case, make the
program use <CODE>#line</CODE> directives in its C output; that way
GDB will know the correct language of the source code of the original
program, and will display that source code, not the generated C code.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC65" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC65">List of filename extensions and languages</A></H3>

<P>
If a source file name ends in one of the following extensions, then
GDB infers that its language is the one indicated.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><TT>`.c'</TT>
<DD>
C source file

<DT><TT>`.C'</TT>
<DD>
<DT><TT>`.cc'</TT>
<DD>
<DT><TT>`.cp'</TT>
<DD>
<DT><TT>`.cpp'</TT>
<DD>
<DT><TT>`.cxx'</TT>
<DD>
<DT><TT>`.c++'</TT>
<DD>
C++ source file

<DT><TT>`.m'</TT>
<DD>

<DT><TT>`.M'</TT>

<DD>
<DT><TT>`.c286'</TT>

<DT><TT>`.mod'</TT>
<DD>
Modula-2 source file

<DT><TT>`.s'</TT>
<DD>
<DT><TT>`.S'</TT>
<DD>
Assembler source file.  This actually behaves almost like C, but
GDB does not skip over function prologues when stepping.
</DL>

<P>
In addition, you may set the language associated with a filename
extension.  See section <A HREF="gdb_10.html#SEC68">Displaying the language</A>.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC66" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC66">Setting the working language</A></H3>

<P>
If you allow GDB to set the language automatically,
expressions are interpreted the same way in your debugging session and
your program.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX352"></A>
If you wish, you may set the language manually.  To do this, issue the
command <SAMP>`set language <VAR>lang</VAR>'</SAMP>, where <VAR>lang</VAR> is the name of
a language, such as 
<CODE>c</CODE> or <CODE>modula-2</CODE>.
For a list of the supported languages, type <SAMP>`set language'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
Setting the language manually prevents GDB from updating the working
language automatically.  This can lead to confusion if you try
to debug a program when the working language is not the same as the
source language, when an expression is acceptable to both
languages--but means different things.  For instance, if the current
source file were written in C, and GDB was parsing Modula-2, a
command such as:

</P>

<PRE>
print a = b + c
</PRE>

<P>
might not have the effect you intended.  In C, this means to add
<CODE>b</CODE> and <CODE>c</CODE> and place the result in <CODE>a</CODE>.  The result
printed would be the value of <CODE>a</CODE>.  In Modula-2, this means to compare
<CODE>a</CODE> to the result of <CODE>b+c</CODE>, yielding a <CODE>BOOLEAN</CODE> value.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC67" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC67">Having GDB infer the source language</A></H3>

<P>
To have GDB set the working language automatically, use
<SAMP>`set language local'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`set language auto'</SAMP>.  GDB
then infers the working language.  That is, when your program stops in a
frame (usually by encountering a breakpoint), GDB sets the
working language to the language recorded for the function in that
frame.  If the language for a frame is unknown (that is, if the function
or block corresponding to the frame was defined in a source file that
does not have a recognized extension), the current working language is
not changed, and GDB issues a warning.

</P>
<P>
This may not seem necessary for most programs, which are written
entirely in one source language.  However, program modules and libraries
written in one source language can be used by a main program written in
a different source language.  Using <SAMP>`set language auto'</SAMP> in this
case frees you from having to set the working language manually.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC68" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC68">Displaying the language</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="SEC69" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC69">Type and range checking</A></H2>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<EM>Warning:</EM> In this release, the GDB commands for type and range
checking are included, but they do not yet have any effect.  This
section documents the intended facilities.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Some languages are designed to guard you against making seemingly common
errors through a series of compile- and run-time checks.  These include
checking the type of arguments to functions and operators, and making
sure mathematical overflows are caught at run time.  Checks such as
these help to ensure a program's correctness once it has been compiled
by eliminating type mismatches, and providing active checks for range
errors when your program is running.

</P>
<P>
GDB can check for conditions like the above if you wish.
Although GDB does not check the statements in your program, it
can check expressions entered directly into GDB for evaluation via
the <CODE>print</CODE> command, for example.  As with the working language,
GDB can also decide whether or not to check automatically based on
your program's source language.  See section <A HREF="gdb_10.html#SEC72">Supported languages</A>,
for the default settings of supported languages.

</P>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX358"></A>
<A NAME="IDX359"></A>


<H3><A NAME="SEC70" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC70">An overview of type checking</A></H3>

<P>
Some languages, such as Modula-2, are strongly typed, meaning that the
arguments to operators and functions have to be of the correct type,
otherwise an error occurs.  These checks prevent type mismatch
errors from ever causing any run-time problems.  For example,

</P>

<PRE>
1 + 2 => 3
but
error--> 1 + 2.3
</PRE>

<P>
The second example fails because the <CODE>CARDINAL</CODE> 1 is not
type-compatible with the <CODE>REAL</CODE> 2.3.

</P>
<P>
For the expressions you use in GDB commands, you can tell the 
GDB type checker to skip checking; 
to treat any mismatches as errors and abandon the expression; 
or to only issue warnings when type mismatches occur, 
but evaluate the expression anyway.  When you choose the last of
these, GDB evaluates expressions like the second example above, but
also issues a warning.

</P>
<P>
Even if you turn type checking off, there may be other reasons 
related to type that prevent GDB from evaluating an expression.  
For instance, GDB does not know how to add an <CODE>int</CODE> and 
a <CODE>struct foo</CODE>.  These particular type errors have nothing to do 
with the language in use, and usually arise from expressions, such as 
the one described above, which make little sense to evaluate anyway.

</P>
<P>
Each language defines to what degree it is strict about type.  For
instance, both Modula-2 and C require the arguments to arithmetical
operators to be numbers.  In C, enumerated types and pointers can be
represented as numbers, so that they are valid arguments to mathematical
operators.  See section <A HREF="gdb_10.html#SEC72">Supported languages</A>, for further
details on specific languages.

</P>
<P>
GDB provides some additional commands for controlling the type checker:

</P>

<A NAME="IDX360"></A>
<A NAME="IDX361"></A>
<A NAME="IDX362"></A>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>set check type auto</CODE>
<DD>
Set type checking on or off based on the current working language.
See section <A HREF="gdb_10.html#SEC72">Supported languages</A>, for the default settings for
each language.

<DT><CODE>set check type on</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>set check type off</CODE>
<DD>
Set type checking on or off, overriding the default setting for the
current working language.  Issue a warning if the setting does not
match the language default.  If any type mismatches occur in
evaluating an expression while typechecking is on, GDB prints a
message and aborts evaluation of the expression.

<DT><CODE>set check type warn</CODE>
<DD>
Cause the type checker to issue warnings, but to always attempt to
evaluate the expression.  Evaluating the expression may still
be impossible for other reasons.  For example, GDB cannot add
numbers and structures.

<DT><CODE>show type</CODE>
<DD>
Show the current setting of the type checker, and whether or not GDB 
is setting it automatically.
</DL>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX363"></A>
<A NAME="IDX364"></A>


<H3><A NAME="SEC71" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC71">An overview of range checking</A></H3>

<P>
In some languages (such as Modula-2), it is an error to exceed the
bounds of a type; this is enforced with run-time checks.  Such range
checking is meant to ensure program correctness by making sure
computations do not overflow, or indices on an array element access do
not exceed the bounds of the array.

</P>
<P>
For expressions you use in GDB commands, you can tell
GDB to treat range errors in one of three ways: ignore them,
always treat them as errors and abandon the expression, or issue
warnings but evaluate the expression anyway.

</P>
<P>
A range error can result from numerical overflow, from exceeding an
array index bound, or when you type a constant that is not a member
of any type.  Some languages, however, do not treat overflows as an
error.  In many implementations of C, mathematical overflow causes the
result to "wrap around" to lower values--for example, if <VAR>m</VAR> is
the largest integer value, and <VAR>s</VAR> is the smallest, then

</P>

<PRE>
<VAR>m</VAR> + 1 => <VAR>s</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
This, too, is specific to individual languages, and in some cases
specific to individual compilers or machines.  See section <A HREF="gdb_10.html#SEC72">Supported languages</A>, for further details on specific languages.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>set check range auto</CODE>

Set range checking on or off based on the current working language.
See section <A HREF="gdb_10.html#SEC72">Supported languages</A>, for the default settings for
each language.

<DT><CODE>set check range on</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>set check range off</CODE>
<DD>
Set range checking on or off, overriding the default setting for the
current working language.  A warning is issued if the setting does not
match the language default.  If a range error occurs, then a message
is printed and evaluation of the expression is aborted.

<DT><CODE>set check range warn</CODE>
<DD>
Output messages when the GDB range checker detects a range error,
but attempt to evaluate the expression anyway.  Evaluating the
expression may still be impossible for other reasons, such as accessing
memory that the process does not own (a typical example from many Unix
systems).

<DT><CODE>show range</CODE>
<DD>
Show the current setting of the range checker, and whether or not it is
being set automatically by GDB.

<H2><A NAME="SEC72" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC72">Supported languages</A></H2>

<P>
GDB supports C, C++, Objective-C, Objective-C++, Fortran,
Java, Chill, assembly, and Modula-2.  Some GDB features may
be used in expressions regardless of the language you use: the
GDB <CODE>@</CODE> and <CODE>::</CODE> operators, and the
<SAMP>`{type}addr'</SAMP> construct (see section <A HREF="gdb_9.html#SEC52">Expressions</A>) can
be used with the constructs of any supported language.

</P>
<P>
The following sections detail to what degree each source language is
supported by GDB.  These sections are not meant to be language
tutorials or references, but serve only as a reference guide to what the
GDB expression parser accepts, and what input and output
formats should look like for different languages.  There are many good
books written on each of these languages; please look to these for a
language reference or tutorial.

The C++ debugging facilities are jointly implemented by the C++
compiler and GDB.  Therefore, to debug your C++ code
effectively, you must compile your C++ programs with a supported
C++ compiler, such as GNU <CODE>g++</CODE>, or the HP ANSI C++
compiler (<CODE>aCC</CODE>).

</P>
<P>
For best results when using GNU C++, use the stabs debugging
format.  You can select that format explicitly with the <CODE>g++</CODE>
command-line options <SAMP>`-gstabs'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-gstabs+'</SAMP>.  See
section `Options for Debugging Your Program or GNU CC' in <CITE>Using GNU CC</CITE>, for more information.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX373"></A>

<P>
Operators must be defined on values of specific types.  For instance,
<CODE>+</CODE> is defined on numbers, but not on structures.  Operators are
often defined on groups of types.

<P>
For the purposes of C and C++, the following definitions hold:

</P>

<UL>

</UL>

<P>
The following operators are supported.  They are listed here
in order of increasing precedence:

</P>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX374"></A>

</P>
<P>
GDB allows you to express the constants of C and C++ in the
following ways:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Integer constants are a sequence of digits.  Octal constants are
specified by a leading <SAMP>`0'</SAMP> (i.e. zero), and hexadecimal constants by
a leading <SAMP>`0x'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`0X'</SAMP>.  Constants may also end with a letter
<SAMP>`l'</SAMP>, specifying that the constant should be treated as a
<CODE>long</CODE> value.

<LI>

Floating point constants are a sequence of digits, followed by a decimal
point, followed by a sequence of digits, and optionally followed by an
exponent.  An exponent is of the form:
<SAMP>`e[[+]|-]<VAR>nnn</VAR>'</SAMP>, where <VAR>nnn</VAR> is another
sequence of digits.  The <SAMP>`+'</SAMP> is optional for positive exponents.

<LI>

Enumerated constants consist of enumerated identifiers, or their
integral equivalents.

<LI>

Character constants are a single character surrounded by single quotes
(<CODE>'</CODE>), or a number--the ordinal value of the corresponding character
(usually its ASCII value).  Within quotes, the single character may
be represented by a letter or by <STRONG>escape sequences</STRONG>, which are of
the form <SAMP>`\<VAR>nnn</VAR>'</SAMP>, where <VAR>nnn</VAR> is the octal representation
of the character's ordinal value; or of the form <SAMP>`\<VAR>x</VAR>'</SAMP>, where
<SAMP>`<VAR>x</VAR>'</SAMP> is a predefined special character--for example,
<SAMP>`\n'</SAMP> for newline.

<LI>

String constants are a sequence of character constants surrounded
by double quotes (<CODE>"</CODE>).

<LI>

Pointer constants are an integral value.  You can also write pointers
to constants using the C operator <SAMP>`&#38;'</SAMP>.

<LI>

Array constants are comma-separated lists surrounded by braces <SAMP>`{'</SAMP>
and <SAMP>`}'</SAMP>; for example, <SAMP>`{1,2,3}'</SAMP> is a three-element array of
integers, <SAMP>`{{1,2}, {3,4}, {5,6}}'</SAMP> is a three-by-two array,
and <SAMP>`{&#38;"hi", &#38;"there", &#38;"fred"}'</SAMP> is a three-element array of pointers.

<EM>Warning:</EM> GDB can only debug C++ code if you use the
proper compiler.  Typically, C++ debugging depends on the use of
additional debugging information in the symbol table, and thus requires
special support.  In particular, if your compiler generates a.out, MIPS
ECOFF, RS/6000 XCOFF, or ELF with stabs extensions to the
symbol table, these facilities are all available.  (With GNU CC,
you can use the <SAMP>`-gstabs'</SAMP> option to request stabs debugging
extensions explicitly.)  Where the object code format is standard
COFF or DWARF in ELF, on the other hand, most of the C++
support in GDB does <EM>not</EM> work.

Member function calls are allowed; you can use expressions like


<PRE>
count = aml-&#62;GetOriginal(x, y)
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX386"></A>
<A NAME="IDX387"></A>
<LI>

While a member function is active (in the selected stack frame), your
expressions have the same namespace available as the member function;
that is, GDB allows implicit references to the class instance
pointer <CODE>this</CODE> following the same rules as C++.

<A NAME="IDX388"></A>
<A NAME="IDX389"></A>
<LI>

You can call overloaded functions; GDB resolves the function
call to the right definition, with one restriction--you must use
arguments of the type required by the function that you want to call.
GDB does not perform conversions requiring constructors or
user-defined type operators.

<A NAME="IDX390"></A>
<LI>

GDB understands variables declared as C++ references; you can use 
them in expressions just as you do in C++ source--they are automatically
dereferenced.

In the parameter list shown when GDB displays a frame, the values of
reference variables are not displayed (unlike other variables); this
avoids clutter, since references are often used for large structures.
The <EM>address</EM> of a reference variable is always shown, unless
you have specified <SAMP>`set print address off'</SAMP>.

<LI>

GDB supports the C++ name resolution operator <CODE>::</CODE>---your
expressions can use it just as expressions in your program do.  Since
one scope may be defined in another, you can use <CODE>::</CODE> repeatedly if
necessary, for example in an expression like
<SAMP>`<VAR>scope1</VAR>::<VAR>scope2</VAR>::<VAR>name</VAR>'</SAMP>.  GDB also allows
resolving name scope by reference to source files, in both C and C++
debugging (see section <A HREF="gdb_9.html#SEC53">Program variables</A>).

If you allow GDB to set type and range checking automatically, they
both default to <CODE>off</CODE> whenever the working language changes to
C or C++.  This happens regardless of whether you or GDB
selects the working language.

</P>
<P>
If you allow GDB to set the language automatically, it
recognizes source files whose names end with <TT>`.c'</TT>, <TT>`.C'</TT>, or
<TT>`.cc'</TT>, etc, and when GDB enters code compiled from one of
these files, it sets the working language to C or C++.

<P>
By default, when GDB parses C or C++ expressions, type checking
is not used.  However, if you turn type checking on, GDB
considers two variables type equivalent if:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The two variables are structured and have the same structure, union, or
enumerated tag.

<LI>

The two variables have the same type name, or types that have been
declared equivalent through <CODE>typedef</CODE>.

</UL>

<P>
Range checking, if turned on, is done on mathematical operations.  Array
indices are not checked, since they are often used to index a pointer
that is not itself an array.

<H4><A NAME="SEC84" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC84">Constants</A></H4>

<P>
GDB allows you to express the constants of Modula-2 in the following
ways:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

Integer constants are simply a sequence of digits.  When used in an
expression, a constant is interpreted to be type-compatible with the
rest of the expression.  Hexadecimal integers are specified by a
trailing <SAMP>`H'</SAMP>, and octal integers by a trailing <SAMP>`B'</SAMP>.

<LI>

Floating point constants appear as a sequence of digits, followed by a
decimal point and another sequence of digits.  An optional exponent can
then be specified, in the form <SAMP>`E[+|-]<VAR>nnn</VAR>'</SAMP>, where
<SAMP>`[+|-]<VAR>nnn</VAR>'</SAMP> is the desired exponent.  All of the
digits of the floating point constant must be valid decimal (base 10)
digits.

<LI>

Character constants consist of a single character enclosed by a pair of
like quotes, either single (<CODE>'</CODE>) or double (<CODE>"</CODE>).  They may
also be expressed by their ordinal value (their ASCII value, usually)
followed by a <SAMP>`C'</SAMP>.

<LI>

String constants consist of a sequence of characters enclosed by a
pair of like quotes, either single (<CODE>'</CODE>) or double (<CODE>"</CODE>).
Escape sequences in the style of C are also allowed.  See section <A HREF="gdb_10.html#SEC75">C and C++ constants</A>, for a brief explanation of escape
sequences.

<LI>

Enumerated constants consist of an enumerated identifier.

<LI>

Boolean constants consist of the identifiers <CODE>TRUE</CODE> and
<CODE>FALSE</CODE>.

<LI>

Pointer constants consist of integral values only.

<LI>

Set constants are not yet supported.

<UL>
<LI>

Unlike in standard Modula-2, pointer constants can be formed by
integers.  This allows you to modify pointer variables during
debugging.  (In standard Modula-2, the actual address contained in a
pointer variable is hidden from you; it can only be modified
through direct assignment to another pointer variable or expression that
returned a pointer.)

<LI>

C escape sequences can be used in strings and characters to represent
non-printable characters.  GDB prints out strings with these
escape sequences embedded.  Single non-printable characters are
printed using the <SAMP>`CHR(<VAR>nnn</VAR>)'</SAMP> format.

<LI>

The assignment operator (<CODE>:=</CODE>) returns the value of its right-hand
argument.

<LI>

All built-in procedures both modify <EM>and</EM> return their argument.

There are a few subtle differences between the Modula-2 scope operator

Using the <CODE>::</CODE> operator makes GDB search the scope

found in the specified scope, then GDB searches all scopes
enclosing the one specified by <VAR>scope</VAR>.

</P>

<H4><A NAME="SEC92" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC92">Locations and their accesses</A></H4>

<P>
A location in Chill is an object which can contain values.

</P>
<P>
A value of a location is generally accessed by the (declared) name of
the location. The output conforms to the specification of values in
Chill programs. How values are specified, and which operations are valid
is the topic of the next section.

</P>
<P>
The pseudo-location <CODE>RESULT</CODE> (or <CODE>result</CODE>) can be used to
display or change the result of a currently-active procedure:

<PRE>
set result := EXPR
</PRE>

<P>
- does the same as the Chill action <CODE>RESULT EXPR</CODE> (which
is not available in gdb).

</P>
<P>
Values of reference mode locations are printed by <CODE>PTR(&#60;hex
value&#62;)</CODE> in case of a free reference mode, and by <CODE>(REF &#60;reference
mode&#62;) (&#60;hex-value&#62;)</CODE> in case of a bound reference. <CODE>&#60;hex value&#62;</CODE>
represents the address where the reference points to.  To access the
value of the location referenced by the pointer, use the dereference
operator `<CODE>-&#62;</CODE>'.

</P>
<P>
Values of procedure mode locations are displayed by <CODE>{ PROC
(&#60;argument modes&#62; ) &#60;return mode&#62; } &#60;address&#62; &#60;name of procedure
location&#62;</CODE>. <CODE>&#60;argument modes&#62;</CODE> is a list of modes according to the
parameter specification of the procedure and <CODE>&#60;address&#62;</CODE> shows the
address of the entry point. 

</P>

<P>
Substructures of string mode-, array mode- or structure mode-values
(e.g. array slices, fields of structure locations) are accessed using
certain operations which are descibed in the next chapter.

</P>
<P>
A location value may be interpreted as having a different mode using the
location conversion. This mode conversion is written as <CODE>&#60;mode
name&#62;(&#60;location&#62;)</CODE>. The user has to consider that the sizes of the modes
have to be equal otherwise an error message occurs. Further no range
checking of the location against the destination mode is performed and
therefore the result can be quite confusing.

<PRE>
(gdb) print int (s(3 up 4)) XXX TO be filled in !! XXX
</PRE>



<H4><A NAME="SEC93" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC93">Values and their Operations</A></H4>

<P>
Values are used to alter locations, to investigate complex structures in
more detail or to filter relevant information out of a large amount of
data. There are several (mode dependent) operations defined which enable
such investigations. These operations are not only applicable to
constant values but also to locations, which can become quite useful
when debugging complex structures. During parsing the command line
(e.g. evaluating an expression) GDB treats location names as
the values behind these locations.

</P>
<P>
This subchapters describes how values have to be specified and which
operations are legal to be used with such values.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>Literal Values</CODE>
<DD>
Literal values are specified in the same manner as in GNU Chill programs.
For detailed specification refer to the GNU Chill implementation Manual
chapter 1.5.

<DT><CODE>Tuple Values</CODE>
<DD>
A tuple is specified by <CODE>&#60;mode name&#62;[&#60;tuple&#62;]</CODE>, where <CODE>&#60;mode
name&#62;</CODE> can be omitted if the mode of the tuple is unambigous. This
unambiguity is derived from the context of a evaluated expression.
<CODE>&#60;tuple&#62;</CODE> can be one of the following:

<UL>
<LI><EM>Powerset Tuple</EM>

<LI><EM>Array Tuple</EM>

<LI><EM>Structure Tuple</EM>

Powerset tuples, array tuples and structure tuples are specified in the
same manner as in Chill programs refer z200/88 chpt 5.2.5.
</UL>

<DT><CODE>String Element Value</CODE>
<DD>
A string element value is specified by <CODE>&#60;string value&#62;(&#60;index&#62;)</CODE>,
where <CODE>&#60;index&#62;</CODE> is a integer expression. It delivers a character
value which is equivalent to the character indexed by <CODE>&#60;index&#62;</CODE> in
the string.

<DT><CODE>String Slice Value</CODE>
<DD>
A string slice value is specified by <CODE>&#60;string value&#62;(&#60;slice
spec&#62;)</CODE>, where <CODE>&#60;slice spec&#62;</CODE> can be either a range of integer
expressions or specified by <CODE>&#60;start expr&#62; up &#60;size&#62;</CODE>.
<CODE>&#60;size&#62;</CODE> denotes the number of elements which the slice contains.
The delivered value is a string value, which is part of the specified
string.

<DT><CODE>Array Element Values</CODE>
<DD>
An array element value is specified by <CODE>&#60;array value&#62;(&#60;expr&#62;)</CODE> and
delivers a array element value of the mode of the specified array.

<DT><CODE>Array Slice Values</CODE>
<DD>
An array slice is specified by <CODE>&#60;array value&#62;(&#60;slice spec&#62;)</CODE>, where
<CODE>&#60;slice spec&#62;</CODE> can be either a range specified by expressions or by
<CODE>&#60;start expr&#62; up &#60;size&#62;</CODE>. <CODE>&#60;size&#62;</CODE> denotes the number of
arrayelements the slice contains. The delivered value is an array value
which is part of the specified array.

<DT><CODE>Structure Field Values</CODE>
<DD>
A structure field value is derived by <CODE>&#60;structure value&#62;.&#60;field
name&#62;</CODE>, where <CODE>&#60;field name&#62;</CODE> indcates the name of a field specified
in the mode definition of the structure. The mode of the delivered value
corresponds to this mode definition in the structure definition.

<DT><CODE>Procedure Call Value</CODE>
<DD>
The procedure call value is derived from the return value of the
procedure<A NAME="DOCF3" HREF="gdb_foot.html#FOOT3">(3)</A>.

Values of duration mode locations are represented by ULONG literals.

Values of time mode locations are represented by TIME(&#60;secs&#62;:&#60;nsecs&#62;).

<DT><CODE>Zero-adic Operator Value</CODE>
<DD>
The zero-adic operator value is derived from the instance value for the
current active process.

<DT><CODE>Expression Values</CODE>
<DD>
The value delivered by an expression is the result of the evaluation of
the specified expression. If there are error conditions (mode
incompatibility, etc.) the evaluation of expressions is aborted with a
corresponding error message. Expressions may be paranthesised which
causes the evaluation of this expression before any other expression
which uses the result of the paranthesised expression. The following
operators are supported by GDB:

<H4><A NAME="SEC94" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC94">Chill type and range checks</A></H4>

<P>
GDB considers two Chill variables mode equivalent if the sizes
of the two modes are equal. This rule applies recursively to more
complex datatypes which means that complex modes are treated
eqivalent if all element modes (which also can be complex modes like
structures, arrays, etc.) have the same size.

</P>
<P>
Range checking is done on all mathematical operations, assignment, array
index bounds and all built in procedures.

</P>
<P>
Strong type checks are forced using the GDB command <CODE>set
check strong</CODE>. This enforces strong type and range checks on all
operations where Chill constructs are used (expressions, built in
functions, etc.) in respect to the semantics as defined in the z.200
language specification.

</P>
<P>
All checks can be disabled by the GDB command <CODE>set check
off</CODE>.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="SEC95" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC95">Chill defaults</A></H4>

<P>
If type and range checking are set automatically by GDB, they
both default to <CODE>on</CODE> whenever the working language changes to
Chill.  This happens regardless of whether you, or GDB,
selected the working language.

</P>
<P>
If you allow GDB to set the language automatically, then entering
code compiled from a file whose name ends with <TT>`.ch'</TT> sets the
working language to Chill. See section <A HREF="gdb_10.html#SEC67">Having GDB infer the source language</A>, for further details.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC96" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC96">Objective-C/C++</A></H3>

<P>
This section provides information about some commands and command
options that are useful for debugging Objective-C and Objective-C++
code.

</P>


<H4><A NAME="SEC97" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC97">Method Names in Commands</A></H4>

<P>
The following commands have been extended to accept Objective-C method
names as line specifications:

</P>

<UL>
<LI><CODE>clear</CODE>

<LI><CODE>break</CODE>

<LI><CODE>info line</CODE>

<LI><CODE>jump</CODE>

<LI><CODE>list</CODE>

</UL>

<P>
For example, to set a breakpoint at the <CODE>create</CODE> instance method of 
class <CODE>Fruit</CODE> in the program currently being debugged, enter:

</P>

<PRE>
break -[Fruit create]
</PRE>

<P>
To list ten program lines around the <CODE>initialize</CODE> class method,
enter:

</P>

<PRE>
list +[NSText initialize]
</PRE>

<P>
In the current version of GDB, the plus or minus sign is required.  In
future versions of GDB, the plus or minus sign will be optional, but you
can use it to narrow the search.  It is also possible to specify just a
method name:

</P>

<PRE>
break create
</PRE>

<P>
You must specify the complete method name, including any colons.  If
your program's source files contain more than one <CODE>create</CODE> method,
you'll be presented with a numbered list of classes that implement that
method.  Indicate your choice by number, or type <SAMP>`0'</SAMP> to exit if
none apply.

</P>
<P>
As another example, to clear a breakpoint established at the
<CODE>makeKeyAndOrderFront:</CODE> method of the <CODE>NSWindow</CODE> class, enter:

</P>

<PRE>
clear -[NSWindow makeKeyAndOrderFront:]
</PRE>

The <CODE>showps</CODE> and <CODE>shownops</CODE> commands turn on and off
(respectively) the display of PostScript code being sent from your
application to the Window Server.  Your application must be running
before you can issue either of these commands.

<A NAME="IDX416"></A>
<DT><CODE>flushps</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>flushps</CODE> command sends pending PostScript code to the Window
Server.  This command lets you flush the application's output buffer,
causing any PostScript code waiting there to be interrupted immediately.
Your application must be running before you can issue this command.

<A NAME="IDX417"></A>
<A NAME="IDX418"></A>
<DT><CODE>traceevents, tracenoevents</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>traceevents</CODE> and <CODE>tracenoevents</CODE> commands turn on

tracing is enabled, all events received from the Window Server are
logged to the standard error output stream.

<A NAME="IDX419"></A>
<DT><CODE>waitps</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>waitps</CODE> command waits until the current Display Postscript
Context is ready to receive more input.
