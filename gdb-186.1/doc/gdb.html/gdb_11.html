<H1><A NAME="SEC101" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC101">Examining the Symbol Table</A></H1>

<P>
The commands described in this section allow you to inquire about the
symbols (names of variables, functions and types) defined in your
program.  This information is inherent in the text of your program and
does not change as your program executes.  GDB finds it in your
program's symbol table, in the file indicated when you started GDB
(see section <A HREF="gdb_3.html#SEC7">Choosing files</A>), or by one of the
file-management commands (see section <A HREF="gdb_13.html#SEC110">Commands to specify files</A>).

Occasionally, you may need to refer to symbols that contain unusual
characters, which GDB ordinarily treats as word delimiters.  The
most frequent case is in referring to static variables in other
source files (see section <A HREF="gdb_9.html#SEC53">Program variables</A>).  File names
are recorded in object files as debugging symbols, but GDB would
ordinarily parse a typical file name, like <TT>`foo.c'</TT>, as the three words
<SAMP>`foo'</SAMP> <SAMP>`.'</SAMP> <SAMP>`c'</SAMP>.  To allow GDB to recognize
<SAMP>`foo.c'</SAMP> as a single symbol, enclose it in single quotes; for example,

</P>

<PRE>
p 'foo.c'::x
</PRE>

<P>
looks up the value of <CODE>x</CODE> in the scope of the file <TT>`foo.c'</TT>.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>info address <VAR>symbol</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX423"></A>
 
Describe where the data for <VAR>symbol</VAR> is stored.  For a register
variable, this says which register it is kept in.  For a non-register
local variable, this prints the stack-frame offset at which the variable
is always stored.

Note the contrast with <SAMP>`print &#38;<VAR>symbol</VAR>'</SAMP>, which does not work
at all for a register variable, and for a stack local variable prints
the exact address of the current instantiation of the variable.

<A NAME="IDX424"></A>
<DT><CODE>whatis <VAR>exp</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Print the data type of expression <VAR>exp</VAR>.  <VAR>exp</VAR> is not
actually evaluated, and any side-effecting operations (such as
assignments or function calls) inside it do not take place.
See section <A HREF="gdb_9.html#SEC52">Expressions</A>.

<DT><CODE>whatis</CODE>
<DD>
Print the data type of <CODE>$</CODE>, the last value in the value history.

<A NAME="IDX425"></A>
<DT><CODE>ptype <VAR>typename</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Print a description of data type <VAR>typename</VAR>.  <VAR>typename</VAR> may be
the name of a type, or for C code it may have the form <SAMP>`class
<VAR>class-name</VAR>'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`struct <VAR>struct-tag</VAR>'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`union
<VAR>union-tag</VAR>'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`enum <VAR>enum-tag</VAR>'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>ptype <VAR>exp</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>ptype</CODE>
<DD>
Print a description of the type of expression <VAR>exp</VAR>.  <CODE>ptype</CODE>
differs from <CODE>whatis</CODE> by printing a detailed description, instead
of just the name of the type.

For example, for this variable declaration:


<PRE>
struct complex {double real; double imag;} v;
</PRE>

the two commands give this output:


<PRE>
(gdb) whatis v
type = struct complex
(gdb) ptype v
type = struct complex {
    double real;
    double imag;
}
</PRE>

As with <CODE>whatis</CODE>, using <CODE>ptype</CODE> without an argument refers to
the type of <CODE>$</CODE>, the last value in the value history.

<A NAME="IDX426"></A>
<DT><CODE>info types <VAR>regexp</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>info types</CODE>
<DD>
Print a brief description of all types whose name matches <VAR>regexp</VAR>
(or all types in your program, if you supply no argument).  Each
complete typename is matched as though it were a complete line; thus,
<SAMP>`i type value'</SAMP> gives information on all types in your program whose
name includes the string <CODE>value</CODE>, but <SAMP>`i type ^value$'</SAMP> gives
information only on types whose complete name is <CODE>value</CODE>.

This command differs from <CODE>ptype</CODE> in two ways: first, like
<CODE>whatis</CODE>, it does not print a detailed description; second, it
lists all source files where a type is defined.

<A NAME="IDX427"></A>
<DT><CODE>info source</CODE>
<DD>
Show the name of the current source file--that is, the source file for
the function containing the current point of execution--and the language
it was written in.

<A NAME="IDX428"></A>
<DT><CODE>info sources</CODE>
<DD>
Print the names of all source files in your program for which there is
debugging information, organized into two lists: files whose symbols
have already been read, and files whose symbols will be read when needed.

<A NAME="IDX429"></A>
<DT><CODE>info functions</CODE>
<DD>
Print the names and data types of all defined functions.

<DT><CODE>info functions <VAR>regexp</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Print the names and data types of all defined functions
whose names contain a match for regular expression <VAR>regexp</VAR>.
Thus, <SAMP>`info fun step'</SAMP> finds all functions whose names
include <CODE>step</CODE>; <SAMP>`info fun ^step'</SAMP> finds those whose names
start with <CODE>step</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX430"></A>
<DT><CODE>info variables</CODE>
<DD>
Print the names and data types of all variables that are declared
outside of functions (i.e., excluding local variables).

<DT><CODE>info variables <VAR>regexp</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Print the names and data types of all variables (except for local
variables) whose names contain a match for regular expression
<VAR>regexp</VAR>.

<A NAME="IDX431"></A>
Some systems allow individual object files that make up your program to
be replaced without stopping and restarting your program.  For example,
in VxWorks you can simply recompile a defective object file and keep on
running.  If you are running on one of these systems, you can allow
GDB to reload the symbols for automatically relinked modules:

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>set symbol-reloading on</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX432"></A>
 
Replace symbol definitions for the corresponding source file when an
object file with a particular name is seen again.

<DT><CODE>set symbol-reloading off</CODE>
<DD>
Do not replace symbol definitions when re-encountering object files of
the same name.  This is the default state; if you are not running on a
system that permits automatically relinking modules, you should leave
<CODE>symbol-reloading</CODE> off, since otherwise GDB may discard symbols
when linking large programs, that may contain several modules (from
different directories or libraries) with the same name.

<A NAME="IDX433"></A>
<DT><CODE>show symbol-reloading</CODE>
<DD>
Show the current <CODE>on</CODE> or <CODE>off</CODE> setting.
</DL>

<A NAME="IDX434"></A>
<A NAME="IDX435"></A>
<A NAME="IDX436"></A>
<A NAME="IDX437"></A>
<DT><CODE>maint print symbols <VAR>filename</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>maint print psymbols <VAR>filename</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>maint print msymbols <VAR>filename</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Write a dump of debugging symbol data into the file <VAR>filename</VAR>.
These commands are used to debug the GDB symbol-reading code.  Only
symbols with debugging data are included.  If you use <SAMP>`maint print
symbols'</SAMP>, GDB includes all the symbols for which it has already
collected full details: that is, <VAR>filename</VAR> reflects symbols for
only those files whose symbols GDB has read.  You can use the
command <CODE>info sources</CODE> to find out which files these are.  If you
use <SAMP>`maint print psymbols'</SAMP> instead, the dump shows information about
symbols that GDB only knows partially--that is, symbols defined in
files that GDB has skimmed, but not yet read completely.  Finally,
<SAMP>`maint print msymbols'</SAMP> dumps just the minimal symbol information
required for each object file from which GDB has read some symbols.
See section <A HREF="gdb_13.html#SEC110">Commands to specify files</A>, for a discussion of how
GDB reads symbols (in the description of <CODE>symbol-file</CODE>).
