<P>
<A NAME="IDX737"></A>
The GDB 4 release includes an already-formatted reference card, ready
for printing with PostScript or Ghostscript, in the <TT>`gdb'</TT>
subdirectory of the main source directory<A NAME="DOCF5" HREF="gdb_foot.html#FOOT5">(5)</A>.  If you can use PostScript or Ghostscript with your printer,
you can print the reference card immediately with <TT>`refcard.ps'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
The release also includes the source for the reference card.  You
can format it, using TeX, by typing:

</P>

<PRE>
make refcard.dvi
</PRE>

<P>
The GDB reference card is designed to print in <STRONG>landscape</STRONG> 
mode on US "letter" size paper; 
that is, on a sheet 11 inches wide by 8.5 inches
high.  You will need to specify this form of printing as an option to
your DVI output program.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX738"></A>

</P>
<P>
All the documentation for GDB comes as part of the machine-readable
distribution.  The documentation is written in Texinfo format, which is
a documentation system that uses a single source file to produce both
on-line information and a printed manual.  You can use one of the Info
formatting commands to create the on-line version of the documentation
and TeX (or <CODE>texi2roff</CODE>) to typeset the printed version.

</P>
<P>
GDB includes an already formatted copy of the on-line Info
version of this manual in the <TT>`gdb'</TT> subdirectory.  The main Info
file is <TT>`gdb-19990707/gdb/gdb.info'</TT>, and it refers to
subordinate files matching <SAMP>`gdb.info*'</SAMP> in the same directory.  If
necessary, you can print out these files, or read them with any editor;
but they are easier to read using the <CODE>info</CODE> subsystem in GNU
Emacs or the standalone <CODE>info</CODE> program, available as part of the
GNU Texinfo distribution.

</P>
<P>
If you want to format these Info files yourself, you need one of the
Info formatting programs, such as <CODE>texinfo-format-buffer</CODE> or
<CODE>makeinfo</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If you have <CODE>makeinfo</CODE> installed, and are in the top level
GDB source directory (<TT>`gdb-19990707'</TT>, in the case of
version 19990707), you can make the Info file by typing:

</P>

<PRE>
cd gdb
make gdb.info
</PRE>

<P>
If you want to typeset and print copies of this manual, you need TeX,
a program to print its DVI output files, and <TT>`texinfo.tex'</TT>, the
Texinfo definitions file.

</P>
<P>
TeX is a typesetting program; it does not print files directly, but
produces output files called DVI files.  To print a typeset
document, you need a program to print DVI files.  If your system
has TeX installed, chances are it has such a program.  The precise
command to use depends on your system; <KBD>lpr -d</KBD> is common; another
(for PostScript devices) is <KBD>dvips</KBD>.  The DVI print command may
require a file name without any extension or a <SAMP>`.dvi'</SAMP> extension.

</P>
<P>
TeX also requires a macro definitions file called
<TT>`texinfo.tex'</TT>.  This file tells TeX how to typeset a document
written in Texinfo format.  On its own, TeX cannot either read or
typeset a Texinfo file.  <TT>`texinfo.tex'</TT> is distributed with GDB
and is located in the <TT>`gdb-<VAR>version-number</VAR>/texinfo'</TT>
directory.

</P>
<P>
If you have TeX and a DVI printer program installed, you can
typeset and print this manual.  First switch to the the <TT>`gdb'</TT>
subdirectory of the main source directory (for example, to
<TT>`gdb-19990707/gdb'</TT>) and type:

</P>

<PRE>
make gdb.dvi
</PRE>

<P>
Then give <TT>`gdb.dvi'</TT> to your DVI printing program.
