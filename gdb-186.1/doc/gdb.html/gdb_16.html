<H1><A NAME="SEC156" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC156">Canned Sequences of Commands</A></H1>

<P>
Aside from breakpoint commands (see section <A HREF="gdb_6.html#SEC35">Breakpoint command lists</A>), GDB provides two ways to store sequences of commands
for execution as a unit: user-defined commands and command files.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC157" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC157">User-defined commands</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX705"></A>
A <STRONG>user-defined command</STRONG> is a sequence of GDB commands to which 
you assign a new name as a command.  This is done with the <CODE>define</CODE>
command.  User commands may accept up to 10 arguments separated by whitespace.
Arguments are accessed within the user command via <VAR>$arg0...$arg9</VAR>.
A trivial example:

</P>

<PRE>
define adder
  print $arg0 + $arg1 + $arg2
</PRE>

<P>
To execute the command use:

</P>

<PRE>
adder 1 2 3
</PRE>

<P>
This defines the command <CODE>adder</CODE>, which prints the sum of
its three arguments.  Note the arguments are text substitutions, so they may 
reference variables, use complex expressions, or even perform inferior
functions calls.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>define <VAR>commandname</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX706"></A>
 
Define a command named <VAR>commandname</VAR>.  If there is already a command
by that name, you are asked to confirm that you want to redefine it.

The definition of the command is made up of other GDB command lines,
which are given following the <CODE>define</CODE> command.  The end of these
commands is marked by a line containing <CODE>end</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX707"></A>
<A NAME="IDX708"></A>
<DT><CODE>if</CODE>
<DD>
Takes a single argument, which is an expression to evaluate.
It is followed by a series of commands that are executed
only if the expression is true (nonzero).
There can then optionally be a line <CODE>else</CODE>, followed
by a series of commands that are only executed if the expression
was false.  The end of the list is marked by a line containing <CODE>end</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX709"></A>
<DT><CODE>while</CODE>
<DD>
The syntax is similar to <CODE>if</CODE>: the command takes a single argument,
which is an expression to evaluate, and must be followed by the commands to
execute, one per line, terminated by an <CODE>end</CODE>.
The commands are executed repeatedly as long as the expression
evaluates to true.

<A NAME="IDX710"></A>
<DT><CODE>document <VAR>commandname</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Document the user-defined command <VAR>commandname</VAR>, so that it can be
accessed by <CODE>help</CODE>.  The command <VAR>commandname</VAR> must already be 
defined.  This command reads lines of documentation just as <CODE>define</CODE> 
reads the lines of the command definition, ending with <CODE>end</CODE>.  
After the <CODE>document</CODE> command is finished, <CODE>help</CODE> on command 
<VAR>commandname</VAR> displays the documentation you have written.

You may use the <CODE>document</CODE> command again to change the
documentation of a command.  Redefining the command with <CODE>define</CODE>
does not change the documentation.

<A NAME="IDX711"></A>
<DT><CODE>help user-defined</CODE>
<DD>
List all user-defined commands, with the first line of the documentation
(if any) for each.

<A NAME="IDX712"></A>
<DT><CODE>show user</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>show user <VAR>commandname</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Display the GDB commands used to define <VAR>commandname</VAR> (but not its
documentation).  If no <VAR>commandname</VAR> is given, display the
definitions for all user-defined commands.
</DL>

<P>
When user-defined commands are executed, the
commands of the definition are not printed.  An error in any command
stops execution of the user-defined command.

</P>
<P>
If used interactively, commands that would ask for confirmation proceed
without asking when used inside a user-defined command.  Many GDB 
commands that normally print messages to say what they are doing omit the 
messages when used in a user-defined command.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC158" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC158">User-defined command hooks</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX713"></A>

</P>
<P>
You may define <EM>hooks</EM>, which are a special kind of user-defined
command.  Whenever you run the command <SAMP>`foo'</SAMP>, if the user-defined
command <SAMP>`hook-foo'</SAMP> exists, it is executed (with no arguments)
before that command.

</P>
<P>
In addition, a pseudo-command, <SAMP>`stop'</SAMP> exists.  Defining
(<SAMP>`hook-stop'</SAMP>) makes the associated commands execute every time
execution stops in your program: before breakpoint commands are run,
displays are printed, or the stack frame is printed.

</P>
<P>
For example, to ignore <CODE>SIGALRM</CODE> signals while
single-stepping, but treat them normally during normal execution,
you could define:

</P>

<PRE>
define hook-stop
handle SIGALRM nopass
end

define hook-run
handle SIGALRM pass
end

define hook-continue
handle SIGLARM pass
end
</PRE>

<P>
You can define a hook for any single-word command in GDB, but
not for command aliases; you should define a hook for the basic command
name, e.g.  <CODE>backtrace</CODE> rather than <CODE>bt</CODE>.
If an error occurs during the execution of your hook, execution of
GDB commands stops and GDB issues a prompt
(before the command that you actually typed had a chance to run).

</P>
<P>
If you try to define a hook which does not match any known command, you
get a warning from the <CODE>define</CODE> command.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC159" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC159">Command files</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX714"></A>
A command file for GDB is a file of lines that are GDB 
commands.  Comments (lines starting with <KBD>#</KBD>) may also be included.  
An empty line in a command file does nothing; it does not mean to repeat 
the last command, as it would from the terminal.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX715"></A>
<A NAME="IDX716"></A>
When you start GDB, it automatically executes commands from its
<STRONG>init files</STRONG>.  These are files named <TT>`.gdbinit'</TT> on Unix, or
<TT>`gdb.ini'</TT> on DOS/Windows.  GDB reads the init file (if
any) in your home directory, then processes command line options and
operands, and then reads the init file (if any) in the current working
directory.  This is so the init file in your home directory can set
options (such as <CODE>set complaints</CODE>) which affect the processing of
the command line options and operands.  The init files are not executed
if you use the <SAMP>`-nx'</SAMP> option; see section <A HREF="gdb_3.html#SEC8">Choosing modes</A>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX717"></A>
On some configurations of GDB, the init file is known by a
different name (these are typically environments where a specialized
form of GDB may need to coexist with other forms, hence a
different name for the specialized version's init file).  These are the
environments with special init file names:

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX718"></A>

<UL>
<LI>

VxWorks (Wind River Systems real-time OS): <SAMP>`.vxgdbinit'</SAMP>

<A NAME="IDX719"></A>
<LI>

OS68K (Enea Data Systems real-time OS): <SAMP>`.os68gdbinit'</SAMP>

<A NAME="IDX720"></A>
<LI>

ES-1800 (Ericsson Telecom AB M68000 emulator): <SAMP>`.esgdbinit'</SAMP>
</UL>

<P>
You can also request the execution of a command file with the
<CODE>source</CODE> command:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>source <VAR>filename</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX721"></A>
 
Execute the command file <VAR>filename</VAR>.
</DL>

<P>
The lines in a command file are executed sequentially.  They are not
printed as they are executed.  An error in any command terminates execution
of the command file.

</P>
<P>
Commands that would ask for confirmation if used interactively proceed
without asking when used in a command file.  Many GDB commands that
normally print messages to say what they are doing omit the messages
when called from command files.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC160" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC160">Commands for controlled output</A></H2>

<P>
During the execution of a command file or a user-defined command, normal
GDB output is suppressed; the only output that appears is what is
explicitly printed by the commands in the definition.  This section
describes three commands useful for generating exactly the output you
want.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>echo <VAR>text</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX722"></A>
 
Print <VAR>text</VAR>.  Nonprinting characters can be included in
<VAR>text</VAR> using C escape sequences, such as <SAMP>`\n'</SAMP> to print a
newline.  <STRONG>No newline is printed unless you specify one.</STRONG>
In addition to the standard C escape sequences, a backslash followed
by a space stands for a space.  This is useful for displaying a
string with spaces at the beginning or the end, since leading and
trailing spaces are otherwise trimmed from all arguments.  
To print <SAMP>` and foo = '</SAMP>, use the command
<SAMP>`echo \ and foo = \ '</SAMP>.

A backslash at the end of <VAR>text</VAR> can be used, as in C, to continue
the command onto subsequent lines.  For example,


<PRE>
echo This is some text\n\
which is continued\n\
onto several lines.\n
</PRE>

produces the same output as


<PRE>
echo This is some text\n
echo which is continued\n
echo onto several lines.\n
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX723"></A>
<DT><CODE>output <VAR>expression</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Print the value of <VAR>expression</VAR> and nothing but that value: no
newlines, no <SAMP>`$<VAR>nn</VAR> = '</SAMP>.  The value is not entered in the
value history either.  See section <A HREF="gdb_9.html#SEC52">Expressions</A>, for more information 
on expressions.

<DT><CODE>output/<VAR>fmt</VAR> <VAR>expression</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Print the value of <VAR>expression</VAR> in format <VAR>fmt</VAR>.  You can use
the same formats as for <CODE>print</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="gdb_9.html#SEC55">Output formats</A>, for more information.

<A NAME="IDX724"></A>
<DT><CODE>printf <VAR>string</VAR>, <VAR>expressions</VAR>...</CODE>
<DD>
Print the values of the <VAR>expressions</VAR> under the control of
<VAR>string</VAR>.  The <VAR>expressions</VAR> are separated by commas and may be
either numbers or pointers.  Their values are printed as specified by
<VAR>string</VAR>, exactly as if your program were to execute the C
subroutine


<PRE>
printf (<VAR>string</VAR>, <VAR>expressions</VAR>...);
</PRE>

For example, you can print two values in hex like this:


<PRE>
printf "foo, bar-foo = 0x%x, 0x%x\n", foo, bar-foo
</PRE>

The only backslash-escape sequences that you can use in the format
string are the simple ones that consist of backslash followed by a
letter.
