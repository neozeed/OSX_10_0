<H1><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC5">Getting In and Out of GDB</A></H1>

<P>
This chapter discusses how to start GDB, and how to get out of it.
The essentials are: 

<UL>
<LI>

type <SAMP>`gdb'</SAMP> to start GDB.
<LI>

type <KBD>quit</KBD> or <KBD>C-d</KBD> to exit.
</UL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC6">Invoking GDB</A></H2>

<P>
Invoke GDB by running the program <CODE>gdb</CODE>.  Once started,
GDB reads commands from the terminal until you tell it to exit.

</P>
<P>
You can also run <CODE>gdb</CODE> with a variety of arguments and options,
to specify more of your debugging environment at the outset.

</P>
<P>
The command-line options described here are designed
to cover a variety of situations; in some environments, some of these
options may effectively be unavailable.  

</P>
<P>
The most usual way to start GDB is with one argument,
specifying an executable program:

</P>

<PRE>
gdb <VAR>program</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
You can also start with both an executable program and a core file
specified:

</P>

<PRE>
gdb <VAR>program</VAR> <VAR>core</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
You can, instead, specify a process ID as a second argument, if you want
to debug a running process:

</P>

<PRE>
gdb <VAR>program</VAR> 1234
</PRE>

<P>
would attach GDB to process <CODE>1234</CODE> (unless you also have a file
named <TT>`1234'</TT>; GDB does check for a core file first).

</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of the second command-line argument requires a fairly
complete operating system; when you use GDB as a remote debugger
attached to a bare board, there may not be any notion of "process",
and there is often no way to get a core dump.

</P>
<P>
You can run <CODE>gdb</CODE> without printing the front material, which describes
GDB's non-warranty, by specifying <CODE>-silent</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
gdb -silent
</PRE>

<P>
You can further control how GDB starts up by using command-line
options.  GDB itself can remind you of the options available.

</P>
<P>
Type

</P>

<PRE>
gdb -help
</PRE>

<P>
to display all available options and briefly describe their use
(<SAMP>`gdb -h'</SAMP> is a shorter equivalent).

</P>
<P>
All options and command line arguments you give are processed
in sequential order.  The order makes a difference when the
<SAMP>`-x'</SAMP> option is used.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC7">Choosing files</A></H3>

<P>
When GDB starts, it reads any arguments other than options as
specifying an executable file and core file (or process ID).  This is
the same as if the arguments were specified by the <SAMP>`-se'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`-c'</SAMP> options respectively.  (GDB reads the first argument
that does not have an associated option flag as equivalent to the
<SAMP>`-se'</SAMP> option followed by that argument; and the second argument
that does not have an associated option flag, if any, as equivalent to
the <SAMP>`-c'</SAMP> option followed by that argument.)

</P>
<P>
If GDB has not been configured to included core file support,
such as for most embedded targets, then it will complain about a second
argument and ignore it.

</P>
<P>
Many options have both long and short forms; both are shown in the
following list.  GDB also recognizes the long forms if you truncate
them, so long as enough of the option is present to be unambiguous.
(If you prefer, you can flag option arguments with <SAMP>`--'</SAMP> rather
than <SAMP>`-'</SAMP>, though we illustrate the more usual convention.)

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-symbols <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>-s <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Read symbol table from file <VAR>file</VAR>.

<DT><CODE>-exec <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>-e <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Use file <VAR>file</VAR> as the executable file to execute when appropriate,
and for examining pure data in conjunction with a core dump.

<DT><CODE>-se <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Read symbol table from file <VAR>file</VAR> and use it as the executable
file.

<DT><CODE>-core <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>-c <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Use file <VAR>file</VAR> as a core dump to examine.

<DT><CODE>-c <VAR>number</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Connect to process ID <VAR>number</VAR>, as with the <CODE>attach</CODE> command
(unless there is a file in core-dump format named <VAR>number</VAR>, in which
case <SAMP>`-c'</SAMP> specifies that file as a core dump to read).

<DT><CODE>-command <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>-x <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Execute GDB commands from file <VAR>file</VAR>.  See section <A HREF="gdb_16.html#SEC159">Command files</A>.

<DT><CODE>-directory <VAR>directory</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>-d <VAR>directory</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Add <VAR>directory</VAR> to the path to search for source files.

<DT><CODE>-m</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>-mapped</CODE>
<DD>
<EM>Warning: this option depends on operating system facilities that are not
supported on all systems.</EM><BR>
If memory-mapped files are available on your system through the <CODE>mmap</CODE>
system call, you can use this option 
to have GDB write the symbols from your
program into a reusable file in the current directory.  If the program you are debugging is
called <TT>`/tmp/fred'</TT>, the mapped symbol file is <TT>`./fred.syms'</TT>.
Future GDB debugging sessions notice the presence of this file,
and can quickly map in symbol information from it, rather than reading
the symbol table from the executable program.

The <TT>`.syms'</TT> file is specific to the host machine where GDB
is run.  It holds an exact image of the internal GDB symbol
table.  It cannot be shared across multiple host platforms.

<DT><CODE>-r</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>-readnow</CODE>
<DD>
Read each symbol file's entire symbol table immediately, rather than
the default, which is to read it incrementally as it is needed.
This makes startup slower, but makes future operations faster.
</DL>

<P>
The <CODE>-mapped</CODE> and <CODE>-readnow</CODE> options are typically combined in
order to build a <TT>`.syms'</TT> file that contains complete symbol
information.  (See section <A HREF="gdb_13.html#SEC110">Commands to specify files</A>, for
information on <TT>`.syms'</TT> files.) A simple GDB invocation to do
nothing but build a <TT>`.syms'</TT> file for future use is:

</P>

<PRE>
	gdb -batch -nx -mapped -readnow programname
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="SEC8" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC8">Choosing modes</A></H3>

<P>
You can run GDB in various alternative modes--for example, in
batch mode or quiet mode.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-nx</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>-n</CODE>
<DD>
Do not execute commands from any initialization files (normally called
<TT>`.gdbinit'</TT>, or <TT>`gdb.ini'</TT> on PCs).  Normally, the commands in
these files are executed after all the command options and arguments
have been processed.  See section <A HREF="gdb_16.html#SEC159">Command files</A>.

<DT><CODE>-quiet</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>-q</CODE>
<DD>
"Quiet".  Do not print the introductory and copyright messages.  These
messages are also suppressed in batch mode.

<DT><CODE>-batch</CODE>
<DD>
Run in batch mode.  Exit with status <CODE>0</CODE> after processing all the
command files specified with <SAMP>`-x'</SAMP> (and all commands from
initialization files, if not inhibited with <SAMP>`-n'</SAMP>).  Exit with
nonzero status if an error occurs in executing the GDB commands
in the command files.

Batch mode may be useful for running GDB as a filter, for example to
download and run a program on another computer; in order to make this
more useful, the message


<PRE>
Program exited normally.
</PRE>

(which is ordinarily issued whenever a program running under GDB control
terminates) is not issued when running in batch mode.

<DT><CODE>-cd <VAR>directory</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Run GDB using <VAR>directory</VAR> as its working directory,
instead of the current directory.

<DT><CODE>-fullname</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>-f</CODE>
<DD>
GNU Emacs sets this option when it runs GDB as a
subprocess.  It tells GDB to output the full file name and line
number in a standard, recognizable fashion each time a stack frame is
displayed (which includes each time your program stops).  This
recognizable format looks like two <SAMP>`\032'</SAMP> characters, followed by
the file name, line number and character position separated by colons,
and a newline.  The Emacs-to-GDB interface program uses the two
<SAMP>`\032'</SAMP> characters as a signal to display the source code for the
frame.

<DT><CODE>-b <VAR>bps</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Set the line speed (baud rate or bits per second) of any serial
interface used by GDB for remote debugging.

<DT><CODE>-tty <VAR>device</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Run using <VAR>device</VAR> for your program's standard input and output.

</DL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC9" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC9">Quitting GDB</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX6"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7"></A>

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>quit</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX8"></A>
 <A NAME="IDX9"></A>
 
To exit GDB, use the <CODE>quit</CODE> command (abbreviated <CODE>q</CODE>), or 
type an end-of-file character (usually <KBD>C-d</KBD>).  If you do not supply 
<VAR>expression</VAR>, GDB will terminate normally; otherwise it will 
terminate using the result of <VAR>expression</VAR> as the error code.
</DL>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX10"></A>
An interrupt (often <KBD>C-c</KBD>) does not exit from GDB, but rather
terminates the action of any GDB command that is in progress and
returns to GDB command level.  It is safe to type the interrupt
character at any time because GDB does not allow it to take effect
until a time when it is safe.

</P>
<P>
If you have been using GDB to control an attached process or
device, you can release it with the <CODE>detach</CODE> command
(see section <A HREF="gdb_5.html#SEC22">Debugging an already-running process</A>).

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC10" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC10">Shell commands</A></H2>

<P>
If you need to execute occasional shell commands during your
debugging session, there is no need to leave or suspend GDB; you can
just use the <CODE>shell</CODE> command.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>shell <VAR>command string</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX11"></A>
 <A NAME="IDX12"></A>
 
Invoke a standard shell to execute <VAR>command string</VAR>.
If it exists, the environment variable <CODE>SHELL</CODE> determines which
shell to run.  Otherwise GDB uses <CODE>/bin/sh</CODE>.
</DL>

<P>
The utility <CODE>make</CODE> is often needed in development environments.
You do not have to use the <CODE>shell</CODE> command for this purpose in
GDB:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>make <VAR>make-args</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX13"></A>
 <A NAME="IDX14"></A>
 
Execute the <CODE>make</CODE> program with the specified
arguments.  This is equivalent to <SAMP>`shell make <VAR>make-args</VAR>'</SAMP>.
