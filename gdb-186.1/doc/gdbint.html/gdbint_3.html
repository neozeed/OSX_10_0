<H1><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="gdbint_toc.html#TOC6">Algorithms</A></H1>

<P>
GDB uses a number of debugging-specific algorithms.  They are often not
very complicated, but get lost in the thicket of special cases and
real-world issues.  This chapter describes the basic algorithms and
mentions some of the specific target definitions that they use.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="gdbint_toc.html#TOC7">Frames</A></H2>

<P>
A frame is a construct that GDB uses to keep track of calling and called
functions.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>FRAME_FP</CODE> in the machine description has no meaning to the
machine-independent part of GDB, except that it is used when setting up
a new frame from scratch, as follows:

</P>

<PRE>
      create_new_frame (read_register (FP_REGNUM), read_pc ()));
</PRE>

<P>
Other than that, all the meaning imparted to <CODE>FP_REGNUM</CODE> is
imparted by the machine-dependent code.  So, <CODE>FP_REGNUM</CODE> can have
any value that is convenient for the code that creates new frames.
(<CODE>create_new_frame</CODE> calls <CODE>INIT_EXTRA_FRAME_INFO</CODE> if it is
defined; that is where you should use the <CODE>FP_REGNUM</CODE> value, if
your frames are nonstandard.)

</P>
<P>
Given a GDB frame, define <CODE>FRAME_CHAIN</CODE> to determine the address of
the calling function's frame.  This will be used to create a new GDB
frame struct, and then <CODE>INIT_EXTRA_FRAME_INFO</CODE> and
<CODE>INIT_FRAME_PC</CODE> will be called for the new frame.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC8" HREF="gdbint_toc.html#TOC8">Breakpoint Handling</A></H2>

<P>
In general, a breakpoint is a user-designated location in the program
where the user wants to regain control if program execution ever reaches
that location.

</P>
<P>
There are two main ways to implement breakpoints; either as "hardware"
breakpoints or as "software" breakpoints.

</P>
<P>
Hardware breakpoints are sometimes available as a builtin debugging
features with some chips.  Typically these work by having dedicated
register into which the breakpoint address may be stored.  If the PC
ever matches a value in a breakpoint registers, the CPU raises an
exception and reports it to GDB.  Another possibility is when an
emulator is in use; many emulators include circuitry that watches the
address lines coming out from the processor, and force it to stop if the
address matches a breakpoint's address.  A third possibility is that the
target already has the ability to do breakpoints somehow; for instance,
a ROM monitor may do its own software breakpoints.  So although these
are not literally "hardware breakpoints", from GDB's point of view
they work the same; GDB need not do nothing more than set the breakpoint
and wait for something to happen.

</P>
<P>
Since they depend on hardware resources, hardware breakpoints may be
limited in number; when the user asks for more, GDB will start trying to
set software breakpoints.

</P>
<P>
Software breakpoints require GDB to do somewhat more work.  The basic
theory is that GDB will replace a program instruction a trap, illegal
divide, or some other instruction that will cause an exception, and then
when it's encountered, GDB will take the exception and stop the program.
When the user says to continue, GDB will restore the original
instruction, single-step, re-insert the trap, and continue on.

</P>
<P>
Since it literally overwrites the program being tested, the program area
must be writeable, so this technique won't work on programs in ROM.  It
can also distort the behavior of programs that examine themselves,
although the situation would be highly unusual.

</P>
<P>
Also, the software breakpoint instruction should be the smallest size of
instruction, so it doesn't overwrite an instruction that might be a jump
target, and cause disaster when the program jumps into the middle of the
breakpoint instruction.  (Strictly speaking, the breakpoint must be no
larger than the smallest interval between instructions that may be jump
targets; perhaps there is an architecture where only even-numbered
instructions may jumped to.)  Note that it's possible for an instruction
set not to have any instructions usable for a software breakpoint,
although in practice only the ARC has failed to define such an
instruction.

</P>
<P>
The basic definition of the software breakpoint is the macro
<CODE>BREAKPOINT</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Basic breakpoint object handling is in <TT>`breakpoint.c'</TT>.  However,
much of the interesting breakpoint action is in <TT>`infrun.c'</TT>.

<H2><A NAME="SEC13" HREF="gdbint_toc.html#TOC13">Longjmp Support</A></H2>

<P>
GDB has support for figuring out that the target is doing a
<CODE>longjmp</CODE> and for stopping at the target of the jump, if we are
stepping.  This is done with a few specialized internal breakpoints,
which are visible in the <CODE>maint info breakpoint</CODE> command.

</P>
<P>
To make this work, you need to define a macro called
<CODE>GET_LONGJMP_TARGET</CODE>, which will examine the <CODE>jmp_buf</CODE>
structure and extract the longjmp target address.  Since <CODE>jmp_buf</CODE>
is target specific, you will need to define it in the appropriate
<TT>`tm-<VAR>xyz</VAR>.h'</TT> file.  Look in <TT>`tm-sun4os4.h'</TT> and
<TT>`sparc-tdep.c'</TT> for examples of how to do this.
