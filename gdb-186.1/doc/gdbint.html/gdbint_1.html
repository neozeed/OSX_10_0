<H1><A NAME="SEC1" HREF="gdbint_toc.html#TOC1">Requirements</A></H1>

<P>
Before diving into the internals, you should understand the formal
requirements and other expectations for GDB.  Although some of these may
seem obvious, there have been proposals for GDB that have run counter to
these requirements.

</P>
<P>
First of all, GDB is a debugger.  It's not designed to be a front panel
for embedded systems.  It's not a text editor.  It's not a shell.  It's
not a programming environment.

</P>
<P>
GDB is an interactive tool.  Although a batch mode is available, GDB's
primary role is to interact with a human programmer.

</P>
<P>
GDB should be responsive to the user.  A programmer hot on the trail of
a nasty bug, and operating under a looming deadline, is going to be very
impatient of everything, including the response time to debugger
commands.

</P>
<P>
GDB should be relatively permissive, such as for expressions.  While the
compiler should be picky (or have the option to be made picky), since
source code lives for a long time usually, the programmer doing
debugging shouldn't be spending time figuring out to mollify the
debugger.

</P>
<P>
GDB will be called upon to deal with really large programs.  Executable
sizes of 50 to 100 megabytes occur regularly, and we've heard reports of
programs approaching 1 gigabyte in size.

</P>
<P>
GDB should be able to run everywhere.  No other debugger is available
for even half as many configurations as GDB supports.

</P>
