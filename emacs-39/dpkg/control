Description: GNU Emacs
 GNU Emacs is the GNU incarnation of the advanced, self-documenting,
 customizable, extensible real-time display editor Emacs.
 .
 We say that Emacs is a "display" editor because normally the text
 being edited is visible on the screen and is updated automatically as
 you type your commands.
 .
 We call it a "real-time" editor because the display is updated very
 frequently, usually after each character or pair of characters you
 type.  This minimizes the amount of information you must keep in your
 head as you edit.
 .
 We call Emacs advanced because it provides facilities that go beyond
 simple insertion and deletion: controlling subprocesses; automatic
 indentation of programs; viewing two or more files at once; editing
 formatted text; and dealing in terms of characters, words, lines,
 sentences, paragraphs, and pages, as well as expressions and comments
 in several different programming languages.
 .
 "Self-documenting" means that at any time you can type a special
 character, `Control-h', to find out what your options are.  You can
 also use it to find out what any command does, or to find all the
 commands that pertain to a topic.
 .
 "Customizable" means that you can change the definitions of Emacs
 commands in little ways.  For example, if you use a programming
 language in which comments start with `<**' and end with `**>', you
 can tell the Emacs comment manipulation commands to use those strings
 Another sort of customization is rearrangement of the command set.
 For example, if you prefer the four basic cursor motion commands (up,
 down, left and right) on keys in a diamond pattern on the keyboard,
 you can rebind the keys that way.
 .
 "Extensible" means that you can go beyond simple customization and
 write entirely new commands, programs in the Lisp language to be run
 by Emacs's own Lisp interpreter.  Emacs is an "on-line extensible"
 system, which means that it is divided into many functions that call
 each other, any of which can be redefined in the middle of an editing
 session.  Almost any part of Emacs can be replaced without making a
 separate copy of all of Emacs.  Most of the editing commands of Emacs
 are written in Lisp already; the few exceptions could have been
 written in Lisp but are written in C for efficiency.  Although only a
 programmer can write an extension, anybody can use it afterward.
